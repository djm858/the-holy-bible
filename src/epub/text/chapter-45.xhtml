					<p class="first-child"><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001001">1</sup>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001002">2</sup>(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001003">3</sup>Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001004">4</sup>And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001005">5</sup>By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001006">6</sup>Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001007">7</sup>To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001008">8</sup>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001009">9</sup>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001010">10</sup>Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001011">11</sup>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001012">12</sup>That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001013">13</sup>Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001014">14</sup>I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001015">15</sup>So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001016">16</sup>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001017">17</sup>For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001018">18</sup>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001019">19</sup>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001020">20</sup>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001021">21</sup>Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001022">22</sup>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001023">23</sup>And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001024">24</sup>Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001025">25</sup>Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001026">26</sup>For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001027">27</sup>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001028">28</sup>And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001029">29</sup>Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001030">30</sup>Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001031">31</sup>Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001032">32</sup>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002001">1</sup>Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002002">2</sup>But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002003">3</sup>And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002004">4</sup>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002005">5</sup>But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002006">6</sup>Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002007">7</sup>To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002008">8</sup>But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002009">9</sup>Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002010">10</sup>But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002011">11</sup>For there is no respect of persons with God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002012">12</sup>For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002013">13</sup>(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002014">14</sup>For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002015">15</sup>Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002016">16</sup>In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002017">17</sup>Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002018">18</sup>And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002019">19</sup>And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002020">20</sup>An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002021">21</sup>Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002022">22</sup>Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002023">23</sup>Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002024">24</sup>For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002025">25</sup>For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002026">26</sup>Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002027">27</sup>And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002028">28</sup>For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002029">29</sup>But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003001">1</sup>What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003002">2</sup>Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003003">3</sup>For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003004">4</sup>God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003005">5</sup>But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003006">6</sup>God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003007">7</sup>For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003008">8</sup>And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003009">9</sup>What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003010">10</sup>As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003011">11</sup>There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003012">12</sup>They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003013">13</sup>Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003014">14</sup>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003015">15</sup>Their feet are swift to shed blood:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003016">16</sup>Destruction and misery are in their ways:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003017">17</sup>And the way of peace have they not known:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003018">18</sup>There is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003019">19</sup>Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003020">20</sup>Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003021">21</sup>But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003022">22</sup>Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003023">23</sup>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003024">24</sup>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003025">25</sup>Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003026">26</sup>To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003027">27</sup>Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003028">28</sup>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003029">29</sup>Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003030">30</sup>Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003031">31</sup>Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004001">1</sup>What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004002">2</sup>For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004003">3</sup>For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004004">4</sup>Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004005">5</sup>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004006">6</sup>Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004007">7</sup>Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004008">8</sup>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004009">9</sup>Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004010">10</sup>How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004011">11</sup>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004012">12</sup>And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004013">13</sup>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004014">14</sup>For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004015">15</sup>Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004016">16</sup>Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004017">17</sup>(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004018">18</sup>Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004019">19</sup>And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004020">20</sup>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004021">21</sup>And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004022">22</sup>And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004023">23</sup>Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004024">24</sup>But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004025">25</sup>Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005001">1</sup>Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005002">2</sup>By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005003">3</sup>And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005004">4</sup>And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005005">5</sup>And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005006">6</sup>For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005007">7</sup>For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005008">8</sup>But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005009">9</sup>Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005010">10</sup>For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005011">11</sup>And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005012">12</sup>Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005013">13</sup>(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005014">14</sup>Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam’s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005015">15</sup>But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005016">16</sup>And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005017">17</sup>For if by one man’s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005018">18</sup>Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005019">19</sup>For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005020">20</sup>Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005021">21</sup>That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008009">9</sup>But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008014">14</sup>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008015">15</sup>For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008016">16</sup>The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008019">19</sup>For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008020">20</sup>For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008021">21</sup>Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008022">22</sup>For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008023">23</sup>And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008024">24</sup>For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008025">25</sup>But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008026">26</sup>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008027">27</sup>And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008028">28</sup>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008029">29</sup>For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008030">30</sup>Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008031">31</sup>What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008032">32</sup>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008033">33</sup>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifieth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008034">34</sup>Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008035">35</sup>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011024">24</sup>For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011025">25</sup>For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011032">32</sup>For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</p>
