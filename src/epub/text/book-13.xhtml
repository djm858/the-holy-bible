				<p><sup id="chapter-17-sup-5">5</sup>For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-17-sup-6">6</sup>Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-17-sup-7">7</sup>Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the <b>Lord</b> of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-17-sup-8">8</sup>And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-17-sup-21">21</sup>And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-17-sup-22">22</sup>For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, <b>Lord</b>, becamest their God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-17-sup-23">23</sup>Therefore now, <b>Lord</b>, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-17-sup-24">24</sup>Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The <b>Lord</b> of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-17-sup-25">25</sup>For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-17-sup-26">26</sup>And now, <b>Lord</b>, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-1">1</sup>And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto Jerusalem.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-2">2</sup>Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the <b>Lord</b>, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-3">3</sup>But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-4">4</sup>Howbeit the <b>Lord</b> God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-5">5</sup>And of all my sons, (for the <b>Lord</b> hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the <b>Lord</b> over Israel.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-6">6</sup>And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-7">7</sup>Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-8">8</sup>Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the <b>Lord</b>, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the <b>Lord</b> your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-9">9</sup>And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the <b>Lord</b> searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-10">10</sup>Take heed now; for the <b>Lord</b> hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-11">11</sup>Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-12">12</sup>And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the <b>Lord</b>, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-13">13</sup>Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the <b>Lord</b>, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-14">14</sup>He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-15">15</sup>Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-16">16</sup>And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-17">17</sup>Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-18">18</sup>And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-19">19</sup>All this, said David, the <b>Lord</b> made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-20">20</sup>And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the <b>Lord</b> God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-21">21</sup>And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-1">1</sup>Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the <b>Lord</b> God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-2">2</sup>Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-3">3</sup>Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-4">4</sup>Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses withal:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-5">5</sup>The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the <b>Lord</b>?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-6">6</sup>Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king’s work, offered willingly,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-7">7</sup>And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-8">8</sup>And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the <b>Lord</b>, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-9">9</sup>Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the <b>Lord</b>: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-10">10</sup>Wherefore David blessed the <b>Lord</b> before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, <b>Lord</b> God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-11">11</sup>Thine, O <b>Lord</b> is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O <b>Lord</b>, and thou art exalted as head above all.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-12">12</sup>Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-13">13</sup>Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-14">14</sup>But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-15">15</sup>For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-16">16</sup>O <b>Lord</b> our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-17">17</sup>I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-18">18</sup>O <b>Lord</b> God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-19">19</sup>And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-20">20</sup>And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the <b>Lord</b> your God. And all the congregation blessed the <b>Lord</b> God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the <b>Lord</b>, and the king.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-21">21</sup>And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the <b>Lord</b>, and offered burnt offerings unto the <b>Lord</b>, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-22">22</sup>And did eat and drink before the <b>Lord</b> on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the <b>Lord</b> to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-23">23</sup>Then Solomon sat on the throne of the <b>Lord</b> as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-24">24</sup>And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-25">25</sup>And the <b>Lord</b> magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-26">26</sup>Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-27">27</sup>And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-28">28</sup>And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-29">29</sup>Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-29-sup-30">30</sup>With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.</p>
