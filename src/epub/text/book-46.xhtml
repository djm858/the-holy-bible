				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-1">1</sup>Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-2">2</sup>Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their’s and our’s:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-3">3</sup>Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-4">4</sup>I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-5">5</sup>That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-6">6</sup>Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-7">7</sup>So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-8">8</sup>Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-9">9</sup>God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-10">10</sup>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-11">11</sup>For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-12">12</sup>Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-13">13</sup>Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-14">14</sup>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-15">15</sup>Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-16">16</sup>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-17">17</sup>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-18">18</sup>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-19">19</sup>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-20">20</sup>Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-21">21</sup>For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-22">22</sup>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-23">23</sup>But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-24">24</sup>But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-25">25</sup>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-26">26</sup>For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-27">27</sup>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-28">28</sup>And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-29">29</sup>That no flesh should glory in his presence.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-30">30</sup>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-31">31</sup>That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-1">1</sup>And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-2">2</sup>For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-3">3</sup>And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-4">4</sup>And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-5">5</sup>That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-6">6</sup>Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-7">7</sup>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-8">8</sup>Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-9">9</sup>But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-10">10</sup>But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-11">11</sup>For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-12">12</sup>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-13">13</sup>Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-14">14</sup>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-15">15</sup>But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-16">16</sup>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</p>

				<h4 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">III</h4>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-1">1</sup>And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-2">2</sup>I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-3">3</sup>For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-4">4</sup>For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-5">5</sup>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-6">6</sup>I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-7">7</sup>So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-8">8</sup>Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-9">9</sup>For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-10">10</sup>According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-11">11</sup>For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-12">12</sup>Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-13">13</sup>Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-14">14</sup>If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-15">15</sup>If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-16">16</sup>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-17">17</sup>If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-18">18</sup>Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-19">19</sup>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-20">20</sup>And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-21">21</sup>Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your’s;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-22">22</sup>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are your’s;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-23">23</sup>And ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.</p>

			<section id="chapter-4" epub:type="chapter">
				<h4 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">IV</h4>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-1">1</sup>Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-2">2</sup>Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-3">3</sup>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-4">4</sup>For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-5">5</sup>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-6">6</sup>And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-7">7</sup>For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-8">8</sup>Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-9">9</sup>For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-10">10</sup>We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-11">11</sup>Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-12">12</sup>And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-13">13</sup>Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-14">14</sup>I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-15">15</sup>For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-16">16</sup>Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-17">17</sup>For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-18">18</sup>Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-19">19</sup>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-20">20</sup>For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-21">21</sup>What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-1">1</sup>It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-2">2</sup>And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-3">3</sup>For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-4">4</sup>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-5">5</sup>To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-6">6</sup>Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-7">7</sup>Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-8">8</sup>Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-9">9</sup>I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-10">10</sup>Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-11">11</sup>But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-12">12</sup>For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-13">13</sup>But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-1">1</sup>Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-2">2</sup>Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-3">3</sup>Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-4">4</sup>If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-5">5</sup>I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-6">6</sup>But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-7">7</sup>Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-8">8</sup>Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-9">9</sup>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-10">10</sup>Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-11">11</sup>And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-12">12</sup>All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-13">13</sup>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-14">14</sup>And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-15">15</sup>Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-16">16</sup>What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-17">17</sup>But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-18">18</sup>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-19">19</sup>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-20">20</sup>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-1">1</sup>Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-2">2</sup>Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-3">3</sup>Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-4">4</sup>The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-5">5</sup>Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-6">6</sup>But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-7">7</sup>For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-8">8</sup>I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-9">9</sup>But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-10">10</sup>And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-11">11</sup>But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-12">12</sup>But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-13">13</sup>And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-14">14</sup>For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-15">15</sup>But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-16">16</sup>For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-17">17</sup>But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-18">18</sup>Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-19">19</sup>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-20">20</sup>Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-21">21</sup>Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-22">22</sup>For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s servant.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-23">23</sup>Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-24">24</sup>Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-25">25</sup>Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-26">26</sup>I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-27">27</sup>Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-34">34</sup>There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-35">35</sup>And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-36">36</sup>But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-37">37</sup>Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-38">38</sup>So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-39">39</sup>The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-7-sup-40">40</sup>But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-1">1</sup>Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-2">2</sup>For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-3">3</sup>But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-4">4</sup>He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-5">5</sup>I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-6">6</sup>Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-7">7</sup>And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-8">8</sup>For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-9">9</sup>So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-10">10</sup>There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-11">11</sup>Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-12">12</sup>Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-13">13</sup>Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-14">14</sup>For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-15">15</sup>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-16">16</sup>Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-17">17</sup>For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-18">18</sup>I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-19">19</sup>Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-20">20</sup>Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-21">21</sup>In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-22">22</sup>Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-23">23</sup>If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-24">24</sup>But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-25">25</sup>And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-26">26</sup>How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-27">27</sup>If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-28">28</sup>But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-29">29</sup>Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-30">30</sup>If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-31">31</sup>For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-32">32</sup>And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-33">33</sup>For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-34">34</sup>Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-35">35</sup>And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-36">36</sup>What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-37">37</sup>If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-38">38</sup>But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-39">39</sup>Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-40">40</sup>Let all things be done decently and in order.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-1">1</sup>Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-2">2</sup>By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-3">3</sup>For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-4">4</sup>And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-5">5</sup>And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-6">6</sup>After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-7">7</sup>After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-8">8</sup>And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-9">9</sup>For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-10">10</sup>But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-11">11</sup>Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-12">12</sup>Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-13">13</sup>But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-14">14</sup>And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-15">15</sup>Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-16">16</sup>For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-17">17</sup>And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-18">18</sup>Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-19">19</sup>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-20">20</sup>But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-21">21</sup>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-22">22</sup>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-23">23</sup>But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-24">24</sup>Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-25">25</sup>For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-26">26</sup>The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-27">27</sup>For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-28">28</sup>And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-29">29</sup>Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-30">30</sup>And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-31">31</sup>I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-32">32</sup>If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-33">33</sup>Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-34">34</sup>Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-35">35</sup>But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-36">36</sup>Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-37">37</sup>And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-38">38</sup>But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-39">39</sup>All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-40">40</sup>There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-41">41</sup>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-42">42</sup>So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-43">43</sup>It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-44">44</sup>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-45">45</sup>And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-46">46</sup>Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-47">47</sup>The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-48">48</sup>As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-49">49</sup>And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-50">50</sup>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-51">51</sup>Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-52">52</sup>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-53">53</sup>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-54">54</sup>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-55">55</sup>O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-56">56</sup>The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-57">57</sup>But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-58">58</sup>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</p>
