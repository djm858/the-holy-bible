					<p class="first-child"><span class="chapter-number">1</span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001001">1</sup>Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001002">2</sup>Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001003">3</sup>It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001004">4</sup>That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001005">5</sup>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001006">6</sup>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001007">7</sup>And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001008">8</sup>And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001009">9</sup>According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001010">10</sup>And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001011">11</sup>And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001012">12</sup>And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001013">13</sup>But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001014">14</sup>And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001015">15</sup>For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother’s womb.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001016">16</sup>And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001017">17</sup>And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001018">18</sup>And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001019">19</sup>And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001020">20</sup>And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001021">21</sup>And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001022">22</sup>And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001023">23</sup>And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001024">24</sup>And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001025">25</sup>Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001026">26</sup>And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001027">27</sup>To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001028">28</sup>And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001029">29</sup>And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001030">30</sup>And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001031">31</sup>And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name <b>Jesus</b>.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001032">32</sup>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001033">33</sup>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001034">34</sup>Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001035">35</sup>And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001036">36</sup>And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001037">37</sup>For with God nothing shall be impossible.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001038">38</sup>And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001039">39</sup>And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001040">40</sup>And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001041">41</sup>And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001042">42</sup>And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001043">43</sup>And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001044">44</sup>For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001045">45</sup>And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001046">46</sup>And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001047">47</sup>And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001048">48</sup>For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001049">49</sup>For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001050">50</sup>And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001051">51</sup>He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001052">52</sup>He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001053">53</sup>He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001054">54</sup>He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001055">55</sup>As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001056">56</sup>And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001057">57</sup>Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001058">58</sup>And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001059">59</sup>And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001060">60</sup>And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001061">61</sup>And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001062">62</sup>And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001063">63</sup>And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001064">64</sup>And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001065">65</sup>And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001066">66</sup>And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001067">67</sup>And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001068">68</sup>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001069">69</sup>And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001070">70</sup>As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001071">71</sup>That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001072">72</sup>To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001073">73</sup>The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001074">74</sup>That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001075">75</sup>In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001076">76</sup>And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001077">77</sup>To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001078">78</sup>Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001079">79</sup>To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001080">80</sup>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><span class="chapter-number">2</span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002001">1</sup>And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002002">2</sup>(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002003">3</sup>And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002004">4</sup>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002005">5</sup>To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002006">6</sup>And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002007">7</sup>And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002008">8</sup>And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002009">9</sup>And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002010">10</sup>And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002011">11</sup>For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002012">12</sup>And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002013">13</sup>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002014">14</sup>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002015">15</sup>And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002016">16</sup>And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002017">17</sup>And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002018">18</sup>And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002019">19</sup>But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002020">20</sup>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002021">21</sup>And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called <b>Jesus</b>, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002022">22</sup>And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002023">23</sup>(As it is written in the law of the <b>Lord</b>, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002024">24</sup>And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002025">25</sup>And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002026">26</sup>And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002027">27</sup>And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002028">28</sup>Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002029">29</sup>Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002030">30</sup>For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002031">31</sup>Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002032">32</sup>A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002033">33</sup>And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002034">34</sup>And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002035">35</sup>(Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002036">36</sup>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002037">37</sup>And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002038">38</sup>And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002039">39</sup>And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002040">40</sup>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002041">41</sup>Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002042">42</sup>And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002043">43</sup>And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002044">44</sup>But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day’s journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002045">45</sup>And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002046">46</sup>And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002047">47</sup>And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002048">48</sup>And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002049">49</sup>And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002050">50</sup>And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002051">51</sup>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002052">52</sup>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003002">2</sup>Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003003">3</sup>And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003004">4</sup>As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003021">21</sup>Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004020">20</sup>And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004022">22</sup>And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph’s son?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004023">23</sup>And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004024">24</sup>And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004025">25</sup>But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004026">26</sup>But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004027">27</sup>And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004028">28</sup>And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004032">32</sup>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004033">33</sup>And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004035">35</sup>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004036">36</sup>And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004037">37</sup>And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004040">40</sup>Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004041">41</sup>And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004042">42</sup>And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004043">43</sup>And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004044">44</sup>And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005002">2</sup>And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005003">3</sup>And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005004">4</sup>Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005005">5</sup>And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005006">6</sup>And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005007">7</sup>And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005008">8</sup>When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005009">9</sup>For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005010">10</sup>And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005011">11</sup>And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005012">12</sup>And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005013">13</sup>And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005014">14</sup>And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005015">15</sup>But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005016">16</sup>And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005017">17</sup>And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005018">18</sup>And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005019">19</sup>And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005020">20</sup>And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005021">21</sup>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005022">22</sup>But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005023">23</sup>Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005024">24</sup>But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005025">25</sup>And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005026">26</sup>And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005027">27</sup>And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005028">28</sup>And he left all, rose up, and followed him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005029">29</sup>And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005030">30</sup>But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005031">31</sup>And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005032">32</sup>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005033">33</sup>And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005035">35</sup>But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005036">36</sup>And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005037">37</sup>And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005038">38</sup>But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007002">2</sup>And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007003">3</sup>And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007004">4</sup>And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007005">5</sup>For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007006">6</sup>Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007007">7</sup>Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007008">8</sup>For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007009">9</sup>When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007010">10</sup>And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007011">11</sup>And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007012">12</sup>Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007013">13</sup>And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007014">14</sup>And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007015">15</sup>And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007016">16</sup>And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007017">17</sup>And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007018">18</sup>And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007019">19</sup>And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007020">20</sup>When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007021">21</sup>And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007022">22</sup>Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007023">23</sup>And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007024">24</sup>And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007027">27</sup>This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007028">28</sup>For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007029">29</sup>And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007030">30</sup>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007031">31</sup>And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007032">32</sup>They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007033">33</sup>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007034">34</sup>The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007035">35</sup>But wisdom is justified of all her children.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007036">36</sup>And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007037">37</sup>And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007038">38</sup>And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007039">39</sup>Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007040">40</sup>And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007041">41</sup>There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007042">42</sup>And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007043">43</sup>Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007044">44</sup>And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007045">45</sup>Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007046">46</sup>My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007047">47</sup>Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007048">48</sup>And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007049">49</sup>And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007050">50</sup>And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008002">2</sup>And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008003">3</sup>And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008004">4</sup>And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spake by a parable:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008005">5</sup>A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008006">6</sup>And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008007">7</sup>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008008">8</sup>And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008009">9</sup>And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008010">10</sup>And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008011">11</sup>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008012">12</sup>Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008013">13</sup>They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008014">14</sup>And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008015">15</sup>But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008016">16</sup>No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008017">17</sup>For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008018">18</sup>Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008019">19</sup>Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not come at him for the press.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008020">20</sup>And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008021">21</sup>And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God, and do it.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008022">22</sup>Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008023">23</sup>But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008024">24</sup>And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008025">25</sup>And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008026">26</sup>And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008027">27</sup>And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008028">28</sup>When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008029">29</sup>(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008030">30</sup>And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many devils were entered into him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008031">31</sup>And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008032">32</sup>And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he suffered them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008033">33</sup>Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008034">34</sup>When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went and told it in the city and in the country.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008035">35</sup>Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008036">36</sup>They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008037">37</sup>Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008038">38</sup>Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008039">39</sup>Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008040">40</sup>And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008041">41</sup>And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him that he would come into his house:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008042">42</sup>For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008043">43</sup>And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008044">44</sup>Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008045">45</sup>And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008046">46</sup>And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008047">47</sup>And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008048">48</sup>And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008049">49</sup>While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008050">50</sup>But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008051">51</sup>And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008052">52</sup>And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008053">53</sup>And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008054">54</sup>And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008055">55</sup>And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded to give her meat.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008056">56</sup>And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009005">5</sup>And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009006">6</sup>And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009007">7</sup>Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009008">8</sup>And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009009">9</sup>And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009010">10</sup>And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009011">11</sup>And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009012">12</sup>And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009013">13</sup>But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat for all this people.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009014">14</sup>For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009015">15</sup>And they did so, and made them all sit down.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009016">16</sup>Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009017">17</sup>And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009018">18</sup>And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people that I am?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009019">19</sup>They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009020">20</sup>He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009021">21</sup>And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that thing;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009022">22</sup>Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009023">23</sup>And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009024">24</sup>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009025">25</sup>For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009026">26</sup>For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father’s, and of the holy angels.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009027">27</sup>But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009028">28</sup>And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009029">29</sup>And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009030">30</sup>And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009031">31</sup>Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009032">32</sup>But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009033">33</sup>And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009034">34</sup>While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009035">35</sup>And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009036">36</sup>And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009037">37</sup>And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009038">38</sup>And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009039">39</sup>And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009040">40</sup>And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009041">41</sup>And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009042">42</sup>And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009043">43</sup>And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009044">44</sup>Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009045">45</sup>But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009046">46</sup>Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009047">47</sup>And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009048">48</sup>And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009049">49</sup>And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009050">50</sup>And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009051">51</sup>And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009052">52</sup>And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009053">53</sup>And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009054">54</sup>And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009055">55</sup>But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009056">56</sup>For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009057">57</sup>And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009058">58</sup>And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009059">59</sup>And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009060">60</sup>Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009061">61</sup>And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009062">62</sup>And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010013">13</sup>Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010014">14</sup>But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010015">15</sup>And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010016">16</sup>He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010017">17</sup>And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010018">18</sup>And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010019">19</sup>Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010020">20</sup>Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010021">21</sup>In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010022">22</sup>All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010023">23</sup>And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010024">24</sup>For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010025">25</sup>And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010026">26</sup>He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010027">27</sup>And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010029">29</sup>But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010030">30</sup>And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010031">31</sup>And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010032">32</sup>And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010033">33</sup>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010034">34</sup>And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010035">35</sup>And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010036">36</sup>Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010037">37</sup>And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010038">38</sup>Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010041">41</sup>And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things:</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011013">13</sup>If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011014">14</sup>And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011015">15</sup>But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011037">37</sup>And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011038">38</sup>And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011039">39</sup>And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011040">40</sup>Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011041">41</sup>But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011042">42</sup>But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011043">43</sup>Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011044">44</sup>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011045">45</sup>Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus saying thou reproachest us also.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011046">46</sup>And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011047">47</sup>Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011048">48</sup>Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011049">49</sup>Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011050">50</sup>That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011051">51</sup>From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011052">52</sup>Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011053">53</sup>And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011054">54</sup>Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012002">2</sup>For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012005">5</sup>But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012013">13</sup>And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012015">15</sup>And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012016">16</sup>And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012022">22</sup>And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012023">23</sup>The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012024">24</sup>Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012025">25</sup>And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012026">26</sup>If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012027">27</sup>Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012028">28</sup>If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012032">32</sup>Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012033">33</sup>Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012034">34</sup>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012037">37</sup>Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012038">38</sup>And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012039">39</sup>And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012041">41</sup>Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us, or even to all?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012042">42</sup>And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012043">43</sup>Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012044">44</sup>Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012045">45</sup>But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012046">46</sup>The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012047">47</sup>And that servant, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012048">48</sup>But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012049">49</sup>I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012050">50</sup>But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012051">51</sup>Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012052">52</sup>For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012053">53</sup>The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012056">56</sup>Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012057">57</sup>Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012058">58</sup>When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013006">6</sup>He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013007">7</sup>Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013010">10</sup>And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013011">11</sup>And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013014">14</sup>And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013015">15</sup>The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015005">5</sup>And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015006">6</sup>And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015007">7</sup>I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015010">10</sup>Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015011">11</sup>And he said, A certain man had two sons:</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015013">13</sup>And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015014">14</sup>And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015015">15</sup>And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015020">20</sup>And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015030">30</sup>But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018031">31</sup>Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018032">32</sup>For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018034">34</sup>And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019002">2</sup>And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019003">3</sup>And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019004">4</sup>And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019005">5</sup>And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019006">6</sup>And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019007">7</sup>And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019008">8</sup>And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019009">9</sup>And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019010">10</sup>For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019011">11</sup>And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019012">12</sup>He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019013">13</sup>And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019014">14</sup>But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019015">15</sup>And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019016">16</sup>Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019017">17</sup>And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019018">18</sup>And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019019">19</sup>And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019020">20</sup>And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019021">21</sup>For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019022">22</sup>And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019023">23</sup>Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019024">24</sup>And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019025">25</sup>(And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019026">26</sup>For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019027">27</sup>But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019028">28</sup>And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019029">29</sup>And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019030">30</sup>Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019031">31</sup>And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019032">32</sup>And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019033">33</sup>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019034">34</sup>And they said, The Lord hath need of him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019035">35</sup>And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019036">36</sup>And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019037">37</sup>And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019038">38</sup>Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019039">39</sup>And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019040">40</sup>And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019041">41</sup>And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019042">42</sup>Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019043">43</sup>For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019044">44</sup>And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019045">45</sup>And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019046">46</sup>Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019047">47</sup>And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019048">48</sup>And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><span class="chapter-number">20</span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020001">1</sup>And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020002">2</sup>And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020003">3</sup>And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020004">4</sup>The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020005">5</sup>And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020006">6</sup>But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020007">7</sup>And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020008">8</sup>And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020009">9</sup>Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020010">10</sup>And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020011">11</sup>And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020012">12</sup>And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020013">13</sup>Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020014">14</sup>But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020015">15</sup>So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020016">16</sup>He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020017">17</sup>And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020018">18</sup>Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020019">19</sup>And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020020">20</sup>And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020021">21</sup>And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020022">22</sup>Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020023">23</sup>But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020024">24</sup>Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar’s.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020025">25</sup>And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar’s, and unto God the things which be God’s.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020026">26</sup>And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020027">27</sup>Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020028">28</sup>Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man’s brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020029">29</sup>There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020030">30</sup>And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020031">31</sup>And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020032">32</sup>Last of all the woman died also.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020033">33</sup>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020034">34</sup>And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020035">35</sup>But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020036">36</sup>Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020037">37</sup>Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020038">38</sup>For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020039">39</sup>Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020040">40</sup>And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020041">41</sup>And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David’s son?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020042">42</sup>And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The <b>Lord</b> said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020043">43</sup>Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020044">44</sup>David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020045">45</sup>Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020046">46</sup>Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022002">2</sup>And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022003">3</sup>Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022004">4</sup>And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022005">5</sup>And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022006">6</sup>And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022007">7</sup>Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022008">8</sup>And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022009">9</sup>And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022010">10</sup>And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022011">11</sup>And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022012">12</sup>And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022013">13</sup>And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022014">14</sup>And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022015">15</sup>And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022016">16</sup>For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022017">17</sup>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022018">18</sup>For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022019">19</sup>And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022020">20</sup>Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022021">21</sup>But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022022">22</sup>And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022023">23</sup>And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022024">24</sup>And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022025">25</sup>And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022026">26</sup>But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022027">27</sup>For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022028">28</sup>Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022029">29</sup>And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022030">30</sup>That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022031">31</sup>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022032">32</sup>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022033">33</sup>And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022034">34</sup>And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022035">35</sup>And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022036">36</sup>Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022037">37</sup>For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022038">38</sup>And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022039">39</sup>And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022040">40</sup>And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022041">41</sup>And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022042">42</sup>Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022043">43</sup>And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022044">44</sup>And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022045">45</sup>And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022046">46</sup>And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022047">47</sup>And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022048">48</sup>But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022049">49</sup>When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022050">50</sup>And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022051">51</sup>And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022052">52</sup>Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022053">53</sup>When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022054">54</sup>Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest’s house. And Peter followed afar off.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022055">55</sup>And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022056">56</sup>But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022057">57</sup>And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022058">58</sup>And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022059">59</sup>And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022060">60</sup>And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022061">61</sup>And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022062">62</sup>And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022063">63</sup>And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022064">64</sup>And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022065">65</sup>And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022066">66</sup>And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022067">67</sup>Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022068">68</sup>And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022069">69</sup>Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022070">70</sup>Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-022071">71</sup>And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023002">2</sup>And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023003">3</sup>And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023004">4</sup>Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023005">5</sup>And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023006">6</sup>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023007">7</sup>And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023008">8</sup>And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023009">9</sup>Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023010">10</sup>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023011">11</sup>And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023012">12</sup>And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023013">13</sup>And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023014">14</sup>Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023015">15</sup>No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023016">16</sup>I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023017">17</sup>(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023018">18</sup>And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023019">19</sup>(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023020">20</sup>Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023021">21</sup>But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023022">22</sup>And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023023">23</sup>And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023024">24</sup>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023025">25</sup>And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023026">26</sup>And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023027">27</sup>And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023028">28</sup>But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023029">29</sup>For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023030">30</sup>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023031">31</sup>For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023032">32</sup>And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023033">33</sup>And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023034">34</sup>Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023035">35</sup>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023036">36</sup>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023037">37</sup>And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023038">38</sup>And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, <b>This is the King of the Jews</b>.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023039">39</sup>And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023040">40</sup>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023041">41</sup>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023042">42</sup>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023043">43</sup>And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023044">44</sup>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023045">45</sup>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023046">46</sup>And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023047">47</sup>Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023048">48</sup>And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023049">49</sup>And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023050">50</sup>And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023051">51</sup>(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023052">52</sup>This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023053">53</sup>And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023054">54</sup>And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023055">55</sup>And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023056">56</sup>And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024002">2</sup>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024003">3</sup>And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024004">4</sup>And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024005">5</sup>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024006">6</sup>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024008">8</sup>And they remembered his words,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024009">9</sup>And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024010">10</sup>It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024011">11</sup>And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024012">12</sup>Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024013">13</sup>And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024021">21</sup>But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024022">22</sup>Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024023">23</sup>And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024024">24</sup>And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024025">25</sup>Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024026">26</sup>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024027">27</sup>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024028">28</sup>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024029">29</sup>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024030">30</sup>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024031">31</sup>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024032">32</sup>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024033">33</sup>And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024034">34</sup>Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024035">35</sup>And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024036">36</sup>And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024037">37</sup>But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024038">38</sup>And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024039">39</sup>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024040">40</sup>And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024041">41</sup>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024042">42</sup>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024043">43</sup>And he took it, and did eat before them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024044">44</sup>And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024045">45</sup>Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024046">46</sup>And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024047">47</sup>And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024048">48</sup>And ye are witnesses of these things.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024049">49</sup>And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024050">50</sup>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024051">51</sup>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024052">52</sup>And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-024053">53</sup>And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</p>
