						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107002">2</sup>Let the redeemed of the <b>Lord</b> say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107003">3</sup>And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107004">4</sup>They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107005">5</sup>Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107006">6</sup>Then they cried unto the <b>Lord</b> in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.</span>

						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107008">8</sup>Oh that men would praise the <b>Lord</b> for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107009">9</sup>For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107010">10</sup>Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107011">11</sup>Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107012">12</sup>Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.</span>

						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107014">14</sup>He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.</span>

						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107015">15</sup>Oh that men would praise the <b>Lord</b> for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span>

						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107016">16</sup>For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107017">17</sup>Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</span>

						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107019">19</sup>Then they cry unto the <b>Lord</b> in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107020">20</sup>He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.</span>

						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107025">25</sup>For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107026">26</sup>They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107027">27</sup>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their witâ€™s end.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107028">28</sup>Then they cry unto the <b>Lord</b> in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107029">29</sup>He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107030">30</sup>Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107031">31</sup>Oh that men would praise the <b>Lord</b> for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107032">32</sup>Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107033">33</sup>He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107034">34</sup>A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107035">35</sup>He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107036">36</sup>And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107037">37</sup>And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107038">38</sup>He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107039">39</sup>Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107040">40</sup>He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107041">41</sup>Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107042">42</sup>The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-107043">43</sup>Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the <b>Lord</b>.</span>
