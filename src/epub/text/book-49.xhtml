				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-22">22</sup>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. <sup id="chapter-5-sup-23">23</sup>For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. <sup id="chapter-5-sup-24">24</sup>Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. <sup id="chapter-5-sup-25">25</sup>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; <sup id="chapter-5-sup-26">26</sup>that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, <sup id="chapter-5-sup-27">27</sup>that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. <sup id="chapter-5-sup-28">28</sup>So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. <sup id="chapter-5-sup-29">29</sup>For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: <sup id="chapter-5-sup-30">30</sup>for we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. <sup id="chapter-5-sup-31">31</sup>For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. <sup id="chapter-5-sup-32">32</sup>This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. <sup id="chapter-5-sup-33">33</sup>Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.</p>
