					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-2">2</sup>Let the redeemed of the <b>Lord</b> say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-3">3</sup>And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-4">4</sup>They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-5">5</sup>Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-6">6</sup>Then they cried unto the <b>Lord</b> in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-7">7</sup>And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-8">8</sup>Oh that men would praise the <b>Lord</b> for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span>

					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-9">9</sup>For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-10">10</sup>Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-11">11</sup>Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-12">12</sup>Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.</span>
					<br/>

					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-20">20</sup>He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-21">21</sup>Oh that men would praise the <b>Lord</b> for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-22">22</sup>And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-23">23</sup>They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-24">24</sup>These see the works of the <b>Lord</b>, and his wonders in the deep.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-25">25</sup>For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-26">26</sup>They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-27">27</sup>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their witâ€™s end.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-28">28</sup>Then they cry unto the <b>Lord</b> in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-29">29</sup>He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-30">30</sup>Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-31">31</sup>Oh that men would praise the <b>Lord</b> for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-32">32</sup>Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-33">33</sup>He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-34">34</sup>A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-35">35</sup>He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-36">36</sup>And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-37">37</sup>And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-38">38</sup>He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-39">39</sup>Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-40">40</sup>He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-41">41</sup>Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-42">42</sup>The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><sup id="chapter-107-sup-43">43</sup>Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the <b>Lord</b>.</span>
