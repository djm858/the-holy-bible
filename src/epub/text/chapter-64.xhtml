					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001002">2</sup>Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001003">3</sup>For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001004">4</sup>I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001005">5</sup>Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001006">6</sup>Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001007">7</sup>Because that for his nameâ€™s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001008">8</sup>We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001009">9</sup>I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001010">10</sup>Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001011">11</sup>Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001012">12</sup>Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001013">13</sup>I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001014">14</sup>But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</p>
