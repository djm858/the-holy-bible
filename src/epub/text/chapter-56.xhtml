			<h2>Book 56 Titus</h2>
			<p>56:001:001 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</p>
			<p>56:001:002 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</p>
			<p>56:001:003 But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</p>
			<p>56:001:004 To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>
			<p>56:001:005 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</p>
			<p>56:001:006 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</p>
			<p>56:001:007 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</p>
			<p>56:001:008 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</p>
			<p>56:001:009 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</p>
			<p>56:001:010 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</p>
			<p>56:001:011 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.</p>
			<p>56:001:012 One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</p>
			<p>56:001:013 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</p>
			<p>56:001:014 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</p>
			<p>56:001:015 Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</p>
			<p>56:001:016 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</p>
			<p>56:002:001 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</p>
			<p>56:002:002 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</p>
			<p>56:002:003 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</p>
			<p>56:002:004 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</p>
			<p>56:002:005 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</p>
			<p>56:002:006 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</p>
			<p>56:002:007 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</p>
			<p>56:002:008 Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</p>
			<p>56:002:009 Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;</p>
			<p>56:002:010 Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</p>
			<p>56:002:011 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</p>
			<p>56:002:012 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</p>
			<p>56:002:013 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</p>
			<p>56:002:014 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</p>
			<p>56:002:015 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</p>
			<p>56:003:001 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</p>
			<p>56:003:002 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</p>
			<p>56:003:003 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</p>
			<p>56:003:004 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</p>
			<p>56:003:005 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</p>
			<p>56:003:006 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</p>
			<p>56:003:007 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
			<p>56:003:008 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</p>
			<p>56:003:009 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
			<p>56:003:010 A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</p>
			<p>56:003:011 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</p>
			<p>56:003:012 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</p>
			<p>56:003:013 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</p>
			<p>56:003:014 And let our’s also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</p>
			<p>56:003:015 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
