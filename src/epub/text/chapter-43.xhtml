					<p class="first-child"><span class="chapter-number">1</span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001001">1</sup>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001002">2</sup>The same was in the beginning with God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001003">3</sup>All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001004">4</sup>In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001005">5</sup>And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001006">6</sup>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001007">7</sup>The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001008">8</sup>He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001009">9</sup>That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001010">10</sup>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001011">11</sup>He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001012">12</sup>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001013">13</sup>Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001014">14</sup>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001015">15</sup>John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001016">16</sup>And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001017">17</sup>For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001018">18</sup>No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001019">19</sup>And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001020">20</sup>And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001021">21</sup>And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001022">22</sup>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001023">23</sup>He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001024">24</sup>And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001025">25</sup>And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001026">26</sup>John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001027">27</sup>He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001028">28</sup>These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001029">29</sup>The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001030">30</sup>This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001031">31</sup>And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001032">32</sup>And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001033">33</sup>And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001034">34</sup>And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001035">35</sup>Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001036">36</sup>And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001037">37</sup>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001038">38</sup>Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001039">39</sup>He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001040">40</sup>One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001041">41</sup>He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001042">42</sup>And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001043">43</sup>The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001044">44</sup>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001045">45</sup>Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001046">46</sup>And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001047">47</sup>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001048">48</sup>Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001049">49</sup>Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001050">50</sup>Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001051">51</sup>And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><span class="chapter-number">2</span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002001">1</sup>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002002">2</sup>And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002003">3</sup>And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002004">4</sup>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002005">5</sup>His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002006">6</sup>And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002007">7</sup>Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002008">8</sup>And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002009">9</sup>When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002010">10</sup>And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002011">11</sup>This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002012">12</sup>After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002013">13</sup>And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002014">14</sup>And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002015">15</sup>And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002016">16</sup>And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002017">17</sup>And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002018">18</sup>Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002019">19</sup>Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002020">20</sup>Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002021">21</sup>But he spake of the temple of his body.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002022">22</sup>When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002023">23</sup>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002024">24</sup>But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002025">25</sup>And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><span class="chapter-number">3</span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003001">1</sup>There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003002">2</sup>The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003003">3</sup>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003004">4</sup>Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003005">5</sup>Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003006">6</sup>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003007">7</sup>Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003008">8</sup>The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003009">9</sup>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003010">10</sup>Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003011">11</sup>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003012">12</sup>If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003013">13</sup>And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003014">14</sup>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003015">15</sup>That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003016">16</sup>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003017">17</sup>For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003018">18</sup>He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003019">19</sup>And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003020">20</sup>For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003021">21</sup>But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003022">22</sup>After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003023">23</sup>And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003024">24</sup>For John was not yet cast into prison.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003025">25</sup>Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003026">26</sup>And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003027">27</sup>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003028">28</sup>Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003029">29</sup>He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003030">30</sup>He must increase, but I must decrease.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003031">31</sup>He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003032">32</sup>And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003033">33</sup>He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003034">34</sup>For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003035">35</sup>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003036">36</sup>He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><span class="chapter-number">4</span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004001">1</sup>When therefore the <b>Lord</b> knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004002">2</sup>(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004003">3</sup>He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004004">4</sup>And he must needs go through Samaria.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004005">5</sup>Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004006">6</sup>Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004007">7</sup>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004008">8</sup>(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004009">9</sup>Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004010">10</sup>Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004011">11</sup>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004012">12</sup>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004013">13</sup>Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004014">14</sup>But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004015">15</sup>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004016">16</sup>Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004017">17</sup>The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004018">18</sup>For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004019">19</sup>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004020">20</sup>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004021">21</sup>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004022">22</sup>Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004023">23</sup>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004024">24</sup>God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004025">25</sup>The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004026">26</sup>Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004027">27</sup>And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004028">28</sup>The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004029">29</sup>Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004030">30</sup>Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004031">31</sup>In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004032">32</sup>But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004033">33</sup>Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004034">34</sup>Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004035">35</sup>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004036">36</sup>And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004037">37</sup>And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004038">38</sup>I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004039">39</sup>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004040">40</sup>So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004041">41</sup>And many more believed because of his own word;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004042">42</sup>And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004043">43</sup>Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004044">44</sup>For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004045">45</sup>Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004046">46</sup>So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004047">47</sup>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004048">48</sup>Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004049">49</sup>The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004050">50</sup>Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004051">51</sup>And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004052">52</sup>Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004053">53</sup>So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004054">54</sup>This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005002">2</sup>Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005003">3</sup>In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005004">4</sup>For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005005">5</sup>And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005006">6</sup>When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005007">7</sup>The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005008">8</sup>Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005009">9</sup>And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005010">10</sup>The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005011">11</sup>He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005012">12</sup>Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005013">13</sup>And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005014">14</sup>Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005015">15</sup>The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005016">16</sup>And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005017">17</sup>But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005018">18</sup>Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005019">19</sup>Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005020">20</sup>For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005021">21</sup>For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005022">22</sup>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005023">23</sup>That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005024">24</sup>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005025">25</sup>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005026">26</sup>For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005027">27</sup>And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005028">28</sup>Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005029">29</sup>And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005030">30</sup>I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005031">31</sup>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005032">32</sup>There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005033">33</sup>Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005034">34</sup>But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005035">35</sup>He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005036">36</sup>But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005037">37</sup>And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005038">38</sup>And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005039">39</sup>Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005040">40</sup>And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005041">41</sup>I receive not honour from men.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005042">42</sup>But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005043">43</sup>I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005044">44</sup>How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005045">45</sup>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005046">46</sup>For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005047">47</sup>But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006002">2</sup>And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006003">3</sup>And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006004">4</sup>And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006005">5</sup>When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006006">6</sup>And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006007">7</sup>Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006008">8</sup>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto him,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006009">9</sup>There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006010">10</sup>And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006011">11</sup>And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006012">12</sup>When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006013">13</sup>Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006014">14</sup>Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006015">15</sup>When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006016">16</sup>And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006017">17</sup>And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006018">18</sup>And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006019">19</sup>So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they were afraid.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006020">20</sup>But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006021">21</sup>Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006022">22</sup>The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006023">23</sup>(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006024">24</sup>When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006025">25</sup>And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006026">26</sup>Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006027">27</sup>Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006028">28</sup>Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006029">29</sup>Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006030">30</sup>They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006031">31</sup>Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006032">32</sup>Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006033">33</sup>For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006034">34</sup>Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006035">35</sup>And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006036">36</sup>But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006037">37</sup>All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006038">38</sup>For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006039">39</sup>And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006040">40</sup>And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006041">41</sup>The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006042">42</sup>And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from heaven?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006043">43</sup>Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006044">44</sup>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006045">45</sup>It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006046">46</sup>Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006047">47</sup>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006048">48</sup>I am that bread of life.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006049">49</sup>Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006050">50</sup>This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006051">51</sup>I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006052">52</sup>The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006053">53</sup>Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006054">54</sup>Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006055">55</sup>For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006056">56</sup>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006057">57</sup>As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006058">58</sup>This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006059">59</sup>These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006060">60</sup>Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006061">61</sup>When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said unto them, Doth this offend you?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006062">62</sup>What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006063">63</sup>It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006064">64</sup>But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006065">65</sup>And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006066">66</sup>From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006067">67</sup>Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006068">68</sup>Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006070">70</sup>Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007004">4</sup>For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007005">5</sup>For neither did his brethren believe in him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007006">6</sup>Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007007">7</sup>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007008">8</sup>Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007009">9</sup>When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007010">10</sup>But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007011">11</sup>Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007012">12</sup>And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007013">13</sup>Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007014">14</sup>Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007015">15</sup>And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007016">16</sup>Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007017">17</sup>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007018">18</sup>He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007019">19</sup>Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007020">20</sup>The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007021">21</sup>Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007022">22</sup>Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007023">23</sup>If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007024">24</sup>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007025">25</sup>Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007026">26</sup>But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007027">27</sup>Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007028">28</sup>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007029">29</sup>But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007030">30</sup>Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007031">31</sup>And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007032">32</sup>The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007033">33</sup>Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007034">34</sup>Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007035">35</sup>Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007036">36</sup>What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007037">37</sup>In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007038">38</sup>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007039">39</sup>(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007040">40</sup>Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007041">41</sup>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007042">42</sup>Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007043">43</sup>So there was a division among the people because of him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007044">44</sup>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007045">45</sup>Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007046">46</sup>The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007047">47</sup>Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007048">48</sup>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007049">49</sup>But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007050">50</sup>Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007051">51</sup>Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007052">52</sup>They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007053">53</sup>And every man went unto his own house.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><span class="chapter-number">8</span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008001">1</sup>Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008002">2</sup>And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008003">3</sup>And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008004">4</sup>They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008005">5</sup>Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008006">6</sup>This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008007">7</sup>So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008008">8</sup>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008009">9</sup>And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008010">10</sup>When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008011">11</sup>She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008012">12</sup>Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008013">13</sup>The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008014">14</sup>Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008015">15</sup>Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008016">16</sup>And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008017">17</sup>It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008018">18</sup>I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008019">19</sup>Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008020">20</sup>These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008021">21</sup>Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008022">22</sup>Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008023">23</sup>And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008024">24</sup>I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008025">25</sup>Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008026">26</sup>I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008027">27</sup>They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008028">28</sup>Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008029">29</sup>And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008030">30</sup>As he spake these words, many believed on him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008031">31</sup>Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008032">32</sup>And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008033">33</sup>They answered him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008034">34</sup>Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008035">35</sup>And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008036">36</sup>If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008037">37</sup>I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008038">38</sup>I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008039">39</sup>They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008040">40</sup>But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008041">41</sup>Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008042">42</sup>Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008043">43</sup>Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008044">44</sup>Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008045">45</sup>And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008046">46</sup>Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008047">47</sup>He that is of God heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008048">48</sup>Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008049">49</sup>Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008050">50</sup>And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008051">51</sup>Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008052">52</sup>Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008053">53</sup>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008054">54</sup>Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008055">55</sup>Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008056">56</sup>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008057">57</sup>Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008058">58</sup>Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008059">59</sup>Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009002">2</sup>And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009003">3</sup>Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009004">4</sup>I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009005">5</sup>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009006">6</sup>When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009007">7</sup>And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009008">8</sup>The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009009">9</sup>Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009010">10</sup>Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009011">11</sup>He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009012">12</sup>Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009013">13</sup>They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009014">14</sup>And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009015">15</sup>Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009016">16</sup>Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009017">17</sup>They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009018">18</sup>But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009019">19</sup>And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009020">20</sup>His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009021">21</sup>But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009022">22</sup>These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009023">23</sup>Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009024">24</sup>Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009025">25</sup>He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009028">28</sup>Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009029">29</sup>We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009030">30</sup>The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009031">31</sup>Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009034">34</sup>They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010019">19</sup>There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010023">23</sup>And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010024">24</sup>Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010025">25</sup>Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><span class="chapter-number">11</span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011001">1</sup>Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011002">2</sup>(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011003">3</sup>Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011004">4</sup>When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011005">5</sup>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011006">6</sup>When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011007">7</sup>Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011008">8</sup>His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011009">9</sup>Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011010">10</sup>But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011011">11</sup>These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011012">12</sup>Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011013">13</sup>Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011014">14</sup>Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011015">15</sup>And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011016">16</sup>Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011017">17</sup>Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011018">18</sup>Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011019">19</sup>And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011020">20</sup>Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011021">21</sup>Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011022">22</sup>But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011023">23</sup>Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011024">24</sup>Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011025">25</sup>Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011026">26</sup>And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011027">27</sup>She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011028">28</sup>And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011029">29</sup>As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011030">30</sup>Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011031">31</sup>The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011032">32</sup>Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011033">33</sup>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011034">34</sup>And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011035">35</sup>Jesus wept.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011036">36</sup>Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011037">37</sup>And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011038">38</sup>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011039">39</sup>Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011040">40</sup>Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011041">41</sup>Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011042">42</sup>And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011043">43</sup>And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011044">44</sup>And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011045">45</sup>Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011046">46</sup>But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011047">47</sup>Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011048">48</sup>If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011049">49</sup>And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011050">50</sup>Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011051">51</sup>And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011052">52</sup>And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011053">53</sup>Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011054">54</sup>Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011055">55</sup>And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011056">56</sup>Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011057">57</sup>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><span class="chapter-number">12</span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012001">1</sup>Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012002">2</sup>There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012003">3</sup>Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012004">4</sup>Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, which should betray him,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012005">5</sup>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012006">6</sup>This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012007">7</sup>Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012008">8</sup>For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012009">9</sup>Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012010">10</sup>But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012011">11</sup>Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012012">12</sup>On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012013">13</sup>Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012014">14</sup>And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012015">15</sup>Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012016">16</sup>These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012017">17</sup>The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012018">18</sup>For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012019">19</sup>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012020">20</sup>And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012021">21</sup>The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012022">22</sup>Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012023">23</sup>And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012024">24</sup>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012025">25</sup>He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012026">26</sup>If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012027">27</sup>Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012028">28</sup>Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012029">29</sup>The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012030">30</sup>Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012031">31</sup>Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012032">32</sup>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012033">33</sup>This he said, signifying what death he should die.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012034">34</sup>The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012035">35</sup>Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012036">36</sup>While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012037">37</sup>But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012038">38</sup>That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012039">39</sup>Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012040">40</sup>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012041">41</sup>These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012042">42</sup>Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012043">43</sup>For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018002">2</sup>And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018003">3</sup>Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018004">4</sup>Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018005">5</sup>They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018006">6</sup>As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018007">7</sup>Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018008">8</sup>Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018009">9</sup>That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018010">10</sup>Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018011">11</sup>Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018012">12</sup>Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018013">13</sup>And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018014">14</sup>Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018015">15</sup>And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018016">16</sup>But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018017">17</sup>Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man’s disciples? He saith, I am not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018018">18</sup>And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018019">19</sup>The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018020">20</sup>Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018021">21</sup>Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018022">22</sup>And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018023">23</sup>Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018024">24</sup>Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018025">25</sup>And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018026">26</sup>One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018027">27</sup>Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018028">28</sup>Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018029">29</sup>Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018030">30</sup>They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018031">31</sup>Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018032">32</sup>That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018033">33</sup>Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018034">34</sup>Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018035">35</sup>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018036">36</sup>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018037">37</sup>Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018038">38</sup>Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018039">39</sup>But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018040">40</sup>Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019002">2</sup>And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019003">3</sup>And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019004">4</sup>Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019005">5</sup>Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019006">6</sup>When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019007">7</sup>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019008">8</sup>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019009">9</sup>And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019010">10</sup>Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019011">11</sup>Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019012">12</sup>And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019013">13</sup>When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019014">14</sup>And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019015">15</sup>But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019016">16</sup>Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019017">17</sup>And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019018">18</sup>Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019019">19</sup>And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was <b>Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews</b>.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019020">20</sup>This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019021">21</sup>Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019022">22</sup>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019023">23</sup>Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019024">24</sup>They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019025">25</sup>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019026">26</sup>When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019027">27</sup>Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019028">28</sup>After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019029">29</sup>Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019030">30</sup>When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019031">31</sup>The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019032">32</sup>Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019033">33</sup>But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019034">34</sup>But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019035">35</sup>And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019036">36</sup>For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019037">37</sup>And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019038">38</sup>And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019039">39</sup>And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019040">40</sup>Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019041">41</sup>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019042">42</sup>There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews’ preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020011">11</sup>But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020015">15</sup>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020016">16</sup>Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020017">17</sup>Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020018">18</sup>Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the <b>Lord</b>, and that he had spoken these things unto her.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020019">19</sup>Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020020">20</sup>And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the <b>Lord</b>.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020022">22</sup>And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:</p>

					<p class="first-child"><span class="chapter-number">21</span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021001">1</sup>After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021002">2</sup>There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021003">3</sup>Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021004">4</sup>But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021005">5</sup>Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They answered him, No.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021006">6</sup>And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021007">7</sup>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher’s coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021008">8</sup>And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021009">9</sup>As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021010">10</sup>Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021011">11</sup>Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021012">12</sup>Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021013">13</sup>Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish likewise.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021014">14</sup>This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021015">15</sup>So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021016">16</sup>He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021017">17</sup>He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021018">18</sup>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021019">19</sup>This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021020">20</sup>Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021021">21</sup>Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021022">22</sup>Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021023">23</sup>Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021024">24</sup>This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021025">25</sup>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.</p>
