				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-1">1</sup>The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. <sup id="chapter-1-sup-2">2</sup>Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity. <sup id="chapter-1-sup-3">3</sup>What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun? <sup id="chapter-1-sup-4">4</sup>One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. <sup id="chapter-1-sup-5">5</sup>The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. <sup id="chapter-1-sup-6">6</sup>The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits. <sup id="chapter-1-sup-7">7</sup>All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again. <sup id="chapter-1-sup-8">8</sup>All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. <sup id="chapter-1-sup-9">9</sup>The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. <sup id="chapter-1-sup-10">10</sup>Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us. <sup id="chapter-1-sup-11">11</sup>There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-12">12</sup>I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. <sup id="chapter-1-sup-13">13</sup>And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. <sup id="chapter-1-sup-14">14</sup>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit. <sup id="chapter-1-sup-15">15</sup>That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. <sup id="chapter-1-sup-16">16</sup>I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. <sup id="chapter-1-sup-17">17</sup>And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. <sup id="chapter-1-sup-18">18</sup>For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-1">1</sup>I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity. <sup id="chapter-2-sup-2">2</sup>I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? <sup id="chapter-2-sup-3">3</sup>I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life. <sup id="chapter-2-sup-4">4</sup>I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: <sup id="chapter-2-sup-5">5</sup>I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits: <sup id="chapter-2-sup-6">6</sup>I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: <sup id="chapter-2-sup-7">7</sup>I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me: <sup id="chapter-2-sup-8">8</sup>I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts. <sup id="chapter-2-sup-9">9</sup>So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. <sup id="chapter-2-sup-10">10</sup>And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour. <sup id="chapter-2-sup-11">11</sup>Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-12">12</sup>And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done. <sup id="chapter-2-sup-13">13</sup>Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness. <sup id="chapter-2-sup-14">14</sup>The wise manâ€™s eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all. <sup id="chapter-2-sup-15">15</sup>Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity. <sup id="chapter-2-sup-16">16</sup>For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-17">17</sup>Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-18">18</sup>Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me. <sup id="chapter-2-sup-19">19</sup>And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity. <sup id="chapter-2-sup-20">20</sup>Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun. <sup id="chapter-2-sup-21">21</sup>For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil. <sup id="chapter-2-sup-22">22</sup>For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun? <sup id="chapter-2-sup-23">23</sup>For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-24">24</sup>There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God. <sup id="chapter-2-sup-25">25</sup>For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I? <sup id="chapter-2-sup-26">26</sup>For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-1">1</sup>So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter. <sup id="chapter-4-sup-2">2</sup>Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive. <sup id="chapter-4-sup-3">3</sup>Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-8-sup-16">16</sup>When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:) <sup id="chapter-8-sup-17">17</sup>then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-9-sup-1">1</sup>For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-9-sup-2">2</sup>All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath. <sup id="chapter-9-sup-3">3</sup>This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-9-sup-4">4</sup>For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion. <sup id="chapter-9-sup-5">5</sup>For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. <sup id="chapter-9-sup-6">6</sup>Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-9-sup-7">7</sup>Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works. <sup id="chapter-9-sup-8">8</sup>Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment. <sup id="chapter-9-sup-9">9</sup>Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun. <sup id="chapter-9-sup-10">10</sup>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-9-sup-11">11</sup>I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. <sup id="chapter-9-sup-12">12</sup>For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-9-sup-13">13</sup>This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me: <sup id="chapter-9-sup-14">14</sup>there was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it: <sup id="chapter-9-sup-15">15</sup>now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man. <sup id="chapter-9-sup-16">16</sup>Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the poor manâ€™s wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard. <sup id="chapter-9-sup-17">17</sup>The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools. <sup id="chapter-9-sup-18">18</sup>Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-10-sup-1">1</sup>Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour. <sup id="chapter-10-sup-2">2</sup>A wise manâ€™s heart is at his right hand; but a foolâ€™s heart at his left. <sup id="chapter-10-sup-3">3</sup>Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool. <sup id="chapter-10-sup-4">4</sup>If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences. <sup id="chapter-10-sup-5">5</sup>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler: <sup id="chapter-10-sup-6">6</sup>folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. <sup id="chapter-10-sup-7">7</sup>I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-10-sup-12">12</sup>The words of a wise manâ€™s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself. <sup id="chapter-10-sup-13">13</sup>The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. <sup id="chapter-10-sup-14">14</sup>A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him? <sup id="chapter-10-sup-15">15</sup>The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-10-sup-16">16</sup>Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning! <sup id="chapter-10-sup-17">17</sup>Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness! <sup id="chapter-10-sup-18">18</sup>By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through. <sup id="chapter-10-sup-19">19</sup>A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things. <sup id="chapter-10-sup-20">20</sup>Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</p>
