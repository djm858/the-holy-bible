			<h2>Book 57 Philemon</h2>
			<p>57:001:001 Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</p>
			<p>57:001:002 And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</p>
			<p>57:001:003 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
			<p>57:001:004 I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</p>
			<p>57:001:005 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</p>
			<p>57:001:006 That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</p>
			<p>57:001:007 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</p>
			<p>57:001:008 Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</p>
			<p>57:001:009 Yet for loveâ€™s sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>
			<p>57:001:010 I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</p>
			<p>57:001:011 Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</p>
			<p>57:001:012 Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</p>
			<p>57:001:013 Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</p>
			<p>57:001:014 But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</p>
			<p>57:001:015 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</p>
			<p>57:001:016 Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</p>
			<p>57:001:017 If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</p>
			<p>57:001:018 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</p>
			<p>57:001:019 I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</p>
			<p>57:001:020 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</p>
			<p>57:001:021 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</p>
			<p>57:001:022 But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</p>
			<p>57:001:023 There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</p>
			<p>57:001:024 Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</p>
			<p>57:001:025 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
