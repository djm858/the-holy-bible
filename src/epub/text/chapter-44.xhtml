					<p class="first-child"><span class="chapter-number">1</span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001001">1</sup>The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001002">2</sup>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001003">3</sup>To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001004">4</sup>And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001005">5</sup>For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001006">6</sup>When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001007">7</sup>And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001008">8</sup>But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001009">9</sup>And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001010">10</sup>And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001011">11</sup>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001012">12</sup>Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath dayâ€™s journey.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001013">13</sup>And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001014">14</sup>These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001015">15</sup>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001016">16</sup>Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001017">17</sup>For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001018">18</sup>Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001019">19</sup>And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001020">20</sup>For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001021">21</sup>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001022">22</sup>Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001023">23</sup>And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001024">24</sup>And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001025">25</sup>That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001026">26</sup>And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><span class="chapter-number">2</span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002001">1</sup>And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002002">2</sup>And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002003">3</sup>And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002004">4</sup>And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002005">5</sup>And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002006">6</sup>Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002007">7</sup>And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002008">8</sup>And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002009">9</sup>Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002010">10</sup>Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002011">11</sup>Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002012">12</sup>And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What meaneth this?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002013">13</sup>Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002014">14</sup>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002015">15</sup>For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002016">16</sup>But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002017">17</sup>And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002018">18</sup>And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002019">19</sup>And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002020">20</sup>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord come:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002021">21</sup>And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002022">22</sup>Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002023">23</sup>Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002024">24</sup>Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002025">25</sup>For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002026">26</sup>Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002027">27</sup>Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002028">28</sup>Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002029">29</sup>Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002030">30</sup>Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002031">31</sup>He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002032">32</sup>This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002033">33</sup>Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002034">34</sup>For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002035">35</sup>Until I make thy foes thy footstool.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002036">36</sup>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002037">37</sup>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002038">38</sup>Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002039">39</sup>For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the <b>Lord</b> our God shall call.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002040">40</sup>And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002041">41</sup>Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002042">42</sup>And they continued stedfastly in the apostlesâ€™ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002043">43</sup>And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002044">44</sup>And all that believed were together, and had all things common;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002045">45</sup>And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002046">46</sup>And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002047">47</sup>Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><span class="chapter-number">3</span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003001">1</sup>Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003002">2</sup>And a certain man lame from his motherâ€™s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003003">3</sup>Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003004">4</sup>And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003005">5</sup>And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003006">6</sup>Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003007">7</sup>And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003008">8</sup>And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003009">9</sup>And all the people saw him walking and praising God:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003010">10</sup>And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003011">11</sup>And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomonâ€™s, greatly wondering.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003012">12</sup>And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003013">13</sup>The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003014">14</sup>But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003015">15</sup>And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003016">16</sup>And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003017">17</sup>And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did also your rulers.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003018">18</sup>But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003019">19</sup>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003020">20</sup>And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003021">21</sup>Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003022">22</sup>For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003023">23</sup>And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003024">24</sup>Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003025">25</sup>Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003026">26</sup>Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004002">2</sup>Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004003">3</sup>And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004004">4</sup>Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004005">5</sup>And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004006">6</sup>And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004007">7</sup>And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004008">8</sup>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004009">9</sup>If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004010">10</sup>Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004011">11</sup>This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004012">12</sup>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004013">13</sup>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004014">14</sup>And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004015">15</sup>But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004016">16</sup>Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004017">17</sup>But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004018">18</sup>And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004019">19</sup>But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004020">20</sup>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004021">21</sup>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all men glorified God for that which was done.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004022">22</sup>For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004023">23</sup>And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004024">24</sup>And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004025">25</sup>Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004026">26</sup>The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004027">27</sup>For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004028">28</sup>For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004029">29</sup>And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004030">30</sup>By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004031">31</sup>And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004032">32</sup>And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004033">33</sup>And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005015">15</sup>Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005016">16</sup>There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005024">24</sup>Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005032">32</sup>And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005033">33</sup>When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005034">34</sup>Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005040">40</sup>And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005041">41</sup>And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008017">17</sup>Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008018">18</sup>And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostlesâ€™ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008020">20</sup>But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008021">21</sup>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008024">24</sup>Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the <b>Lord</b> for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008030">30</sup>And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008031">31</sup>And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008032">32</sup>The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008037">37</sup>And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008038">38</sup>And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008039">39</sup>And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009022">22</sup>But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009023">23</sup>And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009024">24</sup>But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009025">25</sup>Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009031">31</sup>Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009040">40</sup>But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010011">11</sup>And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending upon him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010014">14</sup>But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010015">15</sup>And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010016">16</sup>This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010017">17</sup>Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simonâ€™s house, and stood before the gate,</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010019">19</sup>While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010021">21</sup>Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010022">22</sup>And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010023">23</sup>Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010028">28</sup>And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010029">29</sup>Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010030">30</sup>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010031">31</sup>And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010043">43</sup>To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010044">44</sup>While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010045">45</sup>And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013036">36</sup>For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013045">45</sup>But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013046">46</sup>Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015021">21</sup>For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015022">22</sup>Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brethren:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015023">23</sup>And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015024">24</sup>Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015025">25</sup>It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015026">26</sup>Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015027">27</sup>We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015028">28</sup>For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015029">29</sup>That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015030">30</sup>So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015031">31</sup>Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015032">32</sup>And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015033">33</sup>And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015034">34</sup>Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015035">35</sup>Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015036">36</sup>And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the <b>Lord</b>, and see how they do.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015037">37</sup>And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015038">38</sup>But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015039">39</sup>And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015040">40</sup>And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-015041">41</sup>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-016013">13</sup>And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-016014">14</sup>And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-016015">15</sup>And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-016016">16</sup>And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-016018">18</sup>And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-016019">19</sup>And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-016022">22</sup>And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-016023">23</sup>And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017002">2</sup>And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017003">3</sup>Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017004">4</sup>And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017005">5</sup>But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017006">6</sup>And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017007">7</sup>Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017008">8</sup>And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017009">9</sup>And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017010">10</sup>And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017011">11</sup>These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017012">12</sup>Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017013">13</sup>But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017014">14</sup>And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017015">15</sup>And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017016">16</sup>Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017017">17</sup>Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017018">18</sup>Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017019">19</sup>And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017020">20</sup>For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017021">21</sup>(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017022">22</sup>Then Paul stood in the midst of Marsâ€™ hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017023">23</sup>For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, <b>To the Unknown God</b>. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017024">24</sup>God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017025">25</sup>Neither is worshipped with menâ€™s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017026">26</sup>And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017027">27</sup>That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017028">28</sup>For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017029">29</sup>Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and manâ€™s device.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017030">30</sup>And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017031">31</sup>Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017032">32</sup>And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017033">33</sup>So Paul departed from among them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-017034">34</sup>Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018005">5</sup>And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-018014">14</sup>And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019013">13</sup>Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the <b>Lord</b> Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019014">14</sup>And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019015">15</sup>And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019016">16</sup>And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019017">17</sup>And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019018">18</sup>And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019019">19</sup>Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019020">20</sup>So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019021">21</sup>After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019022">22</sup>So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019023">23</sup>And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019024">24</sup>For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019025">25</sup>Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019026">26</sup>Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019027">27</sup>So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019028">28</sup>And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019029">29</sup>And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paulâ€™s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019030">30</sup>And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019031">31</sup>And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019032">32</sup>Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019033">33</sup>And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019034">34</sup>But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019035">35</sup>And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019036">36</sup>Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019037">37</sup>For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019038">38</sup>Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019039">39</sup>But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019040">40</sup>For we are in danger to be called in question for this dayâ€™s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-019041">41</sup>And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020009">9</sup>And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020010">10</sup>And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020013">13</sup>And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020018">18</sup>And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020022">22</sup>And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-020024">24</sup>But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021002">2</sup>And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021003">3</sup>Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021004">4</sup>And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021005">5</sup>And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021011">11</sup>And when he was come unto us, he took Paulâ€™s girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021012">12</sup>And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021020">20</sup>And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021021">21</sup>And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021022">22</sup>What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-021023">23</sup>Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023005">5</sup>Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023008">8</sup>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023009">9</sup>And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Phariseesâ€™ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023010">10</sup>And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023011">11</sup>And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-023022">22</sup>So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-025004">4</sup>But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-025011">11</sup>For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-025012">12</sup>Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-025013">13</sup>And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-025014">14</sup>And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paulâ€™s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-025017">17</sup>Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-025018">18</sup>Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-025019">19</sup>But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-025020">20</sup>And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-025021">21</sup>But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-025022">22</sup>Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027003">3</sup>And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027004">4</sup>And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027005">5</sup>And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027006">6</sup>And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027007">7</sup>And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027008">8</sup>And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027009">9</sup>Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027010">10</sup>And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027011">11</sup>Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027012">12</sup>And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027013">13</sup>And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027014">14</sup>But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027015">15</sup>And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027016">16</sup>And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027017">17</sup>Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027018">18</sup>And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027019">19</sup>And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027020">20</sup>And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027021">21</sup>But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027022">22</sup>And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any manâ€™s life among you, but of the ship.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027023">23</sup>For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027024">24</sup>Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027025">25</sup>Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027026">26</sup>Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027027">27</sup>But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027028">28</sup>And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027029">29</sup>Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027030">30</sup>And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027031">31</sup>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027032">32</sup>Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027033">33</sup>And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027034">34</sup>Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027035">35</sup>And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027036">36</sup>Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027037">37</sup>And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027038">38</sup>And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027039">39</sup>And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027040">40</sup>And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027041">41</sup>And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027042">42</sup>And the soldiersâ€™ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027043">43</sup>But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-027044">44</sup>And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><span class="chapter-number">28</span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028001">1</sup>And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028002">2</sup>And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028003">3</sup>And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028004">4</sup>And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028005">5</sup>And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028006">6</sup>Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028007">7</sup>In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028008">8</sup>And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028009">9</sup>So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028010">10</sup>Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028011">11</sup>And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028012">12</sup>And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028013">13</sup>And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028014">14</sup>Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028015">15</sup>And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028016">16</sup>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028017">17</sup>And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028018">18</sup>Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028019">19</sup>But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028020">20</sup>For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028021">21</sup>And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028022">22</sup>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028023">23</sup>And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028024">24</sup>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028025">25</sup>And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028026">26</sup>Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028027">27</sup>For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028028">28</sup>Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028029">29</sup>And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028030">30</sup>And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-028031">31</sup>Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</p>
