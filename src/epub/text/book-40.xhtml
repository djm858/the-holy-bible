				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-1">1</sup>The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-2">2</sup>Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-3">3</sup>And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-4">4</sup>And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-5">5</sup>And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-6">6</sup>And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-7">7</sup>And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-8">8</sup>And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-9">9</sup>And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-10">10</sup>And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-11">11</sup>And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-12">12</sup>And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-13">13</sup>And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-16">16</sup>And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-17">17</sup>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-18">18</sup>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-19">19</sup>Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-20">20</sup>But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the <b>Lord</b> appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-21">21</sup>And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name <b>Jesus</b>: for he shall save his people from their sins.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-22">22</sup>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-23">23</sup>Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-24">24</sup>Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-25">25</sup>And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name <b>Jesus</b>.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-1">1</sup>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-2">2</sup>Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-3">3</sup>When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-4">4</sup>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-5">5</sup>And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-6">6</sup>And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-7">7</sup>Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-8">8</sup>And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-9">9</sup>When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-10">10</sup>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-11">11</sup>And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-12">12</sup>And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-13">13</sup>And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-14">14</sup>When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-15">15</sup>And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-16">16</sup>Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-17">17</sup>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-18">18</sup>In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-19">19</sup>But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-20">20</sup>Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child’s life.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-21">21</sup>And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-22">22</sup>But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-2-sup-23">23</sup>And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-1">1</sup>In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-2">2</sup>And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-3">3</sup>For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-4">4</sup>And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-5">5</sup>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-6">6</sup>And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-7">7</sup>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-8">8</sup>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-9">9</sup>And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-10">10</sup>And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-11">11</sup>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-12">12</sup>Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-13">13</sup>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-14">14</sup>But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-15">15</sup>And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-16">16</sup>And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-17">17</sup>And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-1">1</sup>Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-2">2</sup>And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-3">3</sup>And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-4">4</sup>But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-5">5</sup>Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-6">6</sup>And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-7">7</sup>Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-8">8</sup>Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-9">9</sup>And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-10">10</sup>Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-11">11</sup>Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-12">12</sup>Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-13">13</sup>And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-14">14</sup>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-15">15</sup>The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-16">16</sup>The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-17">17</sup>From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-18">18</sup>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-19">19</sup>And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-20">20</sup>And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-21">21</sup>And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-22">22</sup>And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-23">23</sup>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-24">24</sup>And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-25">25</sup>And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-1">1</sup>And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-2">2</sup>And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-3">3</sup>Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-7">7</sup>Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-13">13</sup>Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-14">14</sup>Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-15">15</sup>Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-16">16</sup>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-17">17</sup>Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-18">18</sup>For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-19">19</sup>Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-20">20</sup>For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-21">21</sup>Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-22">22</sup>But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-23">23</sup>Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-25">25</sup>Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-26">26</sup>Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-27">27</sup>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-29">29</sup>And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-30">30</sup>And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-32">32</sup>But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-33">33</sup>Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-34">34</sup>But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-36">36</sup>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-37">37</sup>But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-38">38</sup>Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-39">39</sup>But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-40">40</sup>And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-41">41</sup>And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-42">42</sup>Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-43">43</sup>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-44">44</sup>But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-45">45</sup>That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-46">46</sup>For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-47">47</sup>And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-14">14</sup>For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-16">16</sup>Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-21">21</sup>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-22">22</sup>The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-23">23</sup>But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-25">25</sup>Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-26">26</sup>Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-28">28</sup>And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-29">29</sup>And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-30">30</sup>Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-31">31</sup>Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-32">32</sup>(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-6-sup-33">33</sup>But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-11-sup-2">2</sup>Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-3">3</sup>And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-4">4</sup>And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-5">5</sup>Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-6">6</sup>And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-7">7</sup>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-12">12</sup>For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-13">13</sup>Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-14">14</sup>And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-15">15</sup>For this people’s heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-16">16</sup>But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-17">17</sup>For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-18">18</sup>Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-19">19</sup>When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-20">20</sup>But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-21">21</sup>Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-22">22</sup>He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-23">23</sup>But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-24">24</sup>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-25">25</sup>But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-26">26</sup>But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-27">27</sup>So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-29">29</sup>But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-30">30</sup>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-31">31</sup>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-32">32</sup>Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-33">33</sup>Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-34">34</sup>All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without a parable spake he not unto them:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-35">35</sup>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-36">36</sup>Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-37">37</sup>He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-38">38</sup>The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-39">39</sup>The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-40">40</sup>As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-41">41</sup>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-42">42</sup>And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-43">43</sup>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-44">44</sup>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-45">45</sup>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-46">46</sup>Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-47">47</sup>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-48">48</sup>Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-49">49</sup>So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-50">50</sup>And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-51">51</sup>Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-52">52</sup>Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-53">53</sup>And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-54">54</sup>And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-13-sup-57">57</sup>And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-14-sup-11">11</sup>And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-3">3</sup>But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-4">4</sup>For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-6">6</sup>And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-7">7</sup>Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-8">8</sup>This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-9">9</sup>But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-10">10</sup>And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-15-sup-20">20</sup>These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-18-sup-6">6</sup>But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-18-sup-7">7</sup>Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-18-sup-8">8</sup>Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-18-sup-9">9</sup>And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-18-sup-10">10</sup>Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-18-sup-15">15</sup>Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-18-sup-17">17</sup>And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-18-sup-23">23</sup>Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-18-sup-25">25</sup>But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-18-sup-26">26</sup>The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-18-sup-27">27</sup>Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-18-sup-28">28</sup>But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-18-sup-34">34</sup>And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-18-sup-35">35</sup>So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-1">1</sup>And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-2">2</sup>And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-3">3</sup>The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-4">4</sup>And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-5">5</sup>And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-6">6</sup>Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-7">7</sup>They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-8">8</sup>He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-9">9</sup>And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-10">10</sup>His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-11">11</sup>But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-12">12</sup>For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother’s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-13">13</sup>Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-14">14</sup>But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-15">15</sup>And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-16">16</sup>And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-17">17</sup>And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-18">18</sup>He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-19">19</sup>Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-20">20</sup>The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-21">21</sup>Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-22">22</sup>But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-23">23</sup>Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-24">24</sup>And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-25">25</sup>When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-26">26</sup>But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-27">27</sup>Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-28">28</sup>And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-29">29</sup>And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-19-sup-30">30</sup>But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-1">1</sup>For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-2">2</sup>And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-3">3</sup>And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-4">4</sup>And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-5">5</sup>Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-6">6</sup>And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-7">7</sup>They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-8">8</sup>So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-9">9</sup>And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-10">10</sup>But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-11">11</sup>And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-12">12</sup>Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-13">13</sup>But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-14">14</sup>Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-15">15</sup>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-16">16</sup>So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-17">17</sup>And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said unto them,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-18">18</sup>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-19">19</sup>And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-20">20</sup>Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-21">21</sup>And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-22">22</sup>But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-23">23</sup>And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-24">24</sup>And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brethren.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-25">25</sup>But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-26">26</sup>But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-27">27</sup>And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-28">28</sup>Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-29">29</sup>And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-30">30</sup>And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-31">31</sup>And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou son of David.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-32">32</sup>And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-33">33</sup>They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-20-sup-34">34</sup>So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-1">1</sup>And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-2">2</sup>Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-3">3</sup>And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-4">4</sup>All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-5">5</sup>Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-6">6</sup>And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-7">7</sup>And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-8">8</sup>And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-9">9</sup>And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-10">10</sup>And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-11">11</sup>And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-12">12</sup>And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-13">13</sup>And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-14">14</sup>And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-15">15</sup>And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-16">16</sup>And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-17">17</sup>And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-18">18</sup>Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-19">19</sup>And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-20">20</sup>And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-21">21</sup>Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-22">22</sup>And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-23">23</sup>And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-24">24</sup>And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-25">25</sup>The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-26">26</sup>But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-27">27</sup>And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-28">28</sup>But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-29">29</sup>He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-30">30</sup>And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-31">31</sup>Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-32">32</sup>For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-33">33</sup>Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-34">34</sup>And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-35">35</sup>And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-36">36</sup>Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them likewise.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-37">37</sup>But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-38">38</sup>But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-39">39</sup>And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-40">40</sup>When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-41">41</sup>They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-42">42</sup>Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-43">43</sup>Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-44">44</sup>And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-45">45</sup>And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spake of them.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-21-sup-46">46</sup>But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-1">1</sup>And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-2">2</sup>The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-3">3</sup>And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-4">4</sup>Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-5">5</sup>But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-6">6</sup>And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-7">7</sup>But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-8">8</sup>Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-9">9</sup>Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-10">10</sup>So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-11">11</sup>And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-12">12</sup>And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-13">13</sup>Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-14">14</sup>For many are called, but few are chosen.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-15">15</sup>Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-16">16</sup>And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-17">17</sup>Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-18">18</sup>But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-19">19</sup>Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-20">20</sup>And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-21">21</sup>They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-22">22</sup>When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-23">23</sup>The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-24">24</sup>Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-25">25</sup>Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-26">26</sup>Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-27">27</sup>And last of all the woman died also.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-28">28</sup>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-29">29</sup>Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-30">30</sup>For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-31">31</sup>But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-32">32</sup>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-33">33</sup>And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-34">34</sup>But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-35">35</sup>Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-36">36</sup>Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-37">37</sup>Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-38">38</sup>This is the first and great commandment.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-39">39</sup>And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-40">40</sup>On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-41">41</sup>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-42">42</sup>Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-43">43</sup>He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-44">44</sup>The <b>Lord</b> said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-45">45</sup>If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-22-sup-46">46</sup>And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-3">3</sup>All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-4">4</sup>For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-5">5</sup>But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-6">6</sup>And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the synagogues,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-7">7</sup>And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-8">8</sup>But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-9">9</sup>And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-10">10</sup>Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-12">12</sup>And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-13">13</sup>But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-14">14</sup>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-15">15</sup>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-16">16</sup>Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-22">22</sup>And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-23">23</sup>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-24">24</sup>Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-25">25</sup>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-26">26</sup>Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-27">27</sup>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-28">28</sup>Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-29">29</sup>Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous,</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-33">33</sup>Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-34">34</sup>Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-23-sup-35">35</sup>That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-3">3</sup>Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-4">4</sup>And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-5">5</sup>But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-6">6</sup>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-7">7</sup>There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-11">11</sup>For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-12">12</sup>For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-13">13</sup>Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-28">28</sup>For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-29">29</sup>But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-30">30</sup>And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-31">31</sup>Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-32">32</sup>But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-33">33</sup>Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-34">34</sup>Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-35">35</sup>Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-36">36</sup>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-37">37</sup>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-38">38</sup>Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-39">39</sup>And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-40">40</sup>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-41">41</sup>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-42">42</sup>He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-43">43</sup>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-44">44</sup>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-45">45</sup>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-46">46</sup>Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-47">47</sup>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-48">48</sup>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-49">49</sup>And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-50">50</sup>And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-51">51</sup>And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-52">52</sup>Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-53">53</sup>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-54">54</sup>But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-55">55</sup>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-56">56</sup>But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-57">57</sup>And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-58">58</sup>But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-59">59</sup>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-60">60</sup>But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-61">61</sup>And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-62">62</sup>And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-63">63</sup>But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-64">64</sup>Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-65">65</sup>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-66">66</sup>What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-67">67</sup>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-68">68</sup>Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-69">69</sup>Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-70">70</sup>But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-71">71</sup>And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-72">72</sup>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-73">73</sup>And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-74">74</sup>Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-26-sup-75">75</sup>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-1">1</sup>When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-2">2</sup>And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-3">3</sup>Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-4">4</sup>Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-5">5</sup>And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-6">6</sup>And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-7">7</sup>And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-8">8</sup>Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-9">9</sup>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-10">10</sup>And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-11">11</sup>And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-12">12</sup>And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-13">13</sup>Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-14">14</sup>And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-15">15</sup>Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner, whom they would.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-16">16</sup>And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-17">17</sup>Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-18">18</sup>For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-19">19</sup>When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-20">20</sup>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-21">21</sup>The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-22">22</sup>Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-23">23</sup>And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-24">24</sup>When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see ye to it.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-25">25</sup>Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-26">26</sup>Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-27">27</sup>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-28">28</sup>And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-29">29</sup>And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-30">30</sup>And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-31">31</sup>And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-32">32</sup>And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-33">33</sup>And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-34">34</sup>They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-35">35</sup>And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-36">36</sup>And sitting down they watched him there;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-37">37</sup>And set up over his head his accusation written, <b>This is Jesus the King of the Jews</b>.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-38">38</sup>Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-39">39</sup>And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-40">40</sup>And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-41">41</sup>Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-42">42</sup>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-43">43</sup>He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-44">44</sup>The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-45">45</sup>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-46">46</sup>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-47">47</sup>Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-48">48</sup>And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-49">49</sup>The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-50">50</sup>Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-51">51</sup>And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-52">52</sup>And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-53">53</sup>And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-54">54</sup>Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-55">55</sup>And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-56">56</sup>Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-57">57</sup>When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-58">58</sup>He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-59">59</sup>And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-60">60</sup>And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and departed.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-61">61</sup>And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-62">62</sup>Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-63">63</sup>Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-64">64</sup>Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-65">65</sup>Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-27-sup-66">66</sup>So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-1">1</sup>In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-2">2</sup>And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-3">3</sup>His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-4">4</sup>And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-5">5</sup>And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-6">6</sup>He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-7">7</sup>And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-8">8</sup>And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-9">9</sup>And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-10">10</sup>Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-11">11</sup>Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-12">12</sup>And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-13">13</sup>Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-14">14</sup>And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-15">15</sup>So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-16">16</sup>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-17">17</sup>And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-18">18</sup>And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-19">19</sup>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-28-sup-20">20</sup>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.</p>
