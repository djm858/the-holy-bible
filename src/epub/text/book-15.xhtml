				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-1">1</sup>Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the <b>Lord</b> by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the <b>Lord</b> stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-2">2</sup>Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The <b>Lord</b> God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-3">3</sup>Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the <b>Lord</b> God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-4">4</sup>And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-5">5</sup>Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the <b>Lord</b> which is in Jerusalem.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-6">6</sup>And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-7">7</sup>Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the <b>Lord</b>, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-8">8</sup>Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-9">9</sup>And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-10">10</sup>Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-11">11</sup>All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-1">1</sup>And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-2">2</sup>Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-3">3</sup>And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the <b>Lord</b>, even burnt offerings morning and evening.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-4">4</sup>They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-5">5</sup>And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the <b>Lord</b> that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-6">6</sup>From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the <b>Lord</b>. But the foundation of the temple of the <b>Lord</b> was not yet laid.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-7">7</sup>They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-8">8</sup>Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-9">9</sup>Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren the Levites.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-10">10</sup>And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the <b>Lord</b>, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the <b>Lord</b>, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-11">11</sup>And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the <b>Lord</b>; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the <b>Lord</b>, because the foundation of the house of the <b>Lord</b> was laid.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-12">12</sup>But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-3-sup-13">13</sup>So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-1">1</sup>Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the <b>Lord</b> God of Israel;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-2">2</sup>Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-3">3</sup>But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the <b>Lord</b> God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-4">4</sup>Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-5">5</sup>And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-6">6</sup>And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-7">7</sup>And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-8">8</sup>Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-9">9</sup>Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-10">10</sup>And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest that are on this side the river, and at such a time.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-11">11</sup>This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-12">12</sup>Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-13">13</sup>Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-14">14</sup>Now because we have maintenance from the kingâ€™s palace, and it was not meet for us to see the kingâ€™s dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-15">15</sup>That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-16">16</sup>We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-17">17</sup>Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-18">18</sup>The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-19">19</sup>And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-20">20</sup>There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-21">21</sup>Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be given from me.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-22">22</sup>Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-23">23</sup>Now when the copy of king Artaxerxesâ€™ letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-4-sup-24">24</sup>Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</p>

				<p><sup id="chapter-5-sup-12">12</sup>But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.</p>
