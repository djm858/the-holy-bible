			<h2>Book 63 2 John</h2>
			<p>63:001:001 The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;</p>
			<p>63:001:002 For the truthâ€™s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</p>
			<p>63:001:003 Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>
			<p>63:001:004 I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</p>
			<p>63:001:005 And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</p>
			<p>63:001:006 And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.</p>
			<p>63:001:007 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</p>
			<p>63:001:008 Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</p>
			<p>63:001:009 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</p>
			<p>63:001:010 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:</p>
			<p>63:001:011 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</p>
			<p>63:001:012 Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</p>
			<p>63:001:013 The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.</p>
