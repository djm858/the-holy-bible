				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-1">1</sup>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-2">2</sup>And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-3">3</sup>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-4">4</sup>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-5">5</sup>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-6">6</sup>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-7">7</sup>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-8">8</sup>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-9">9</sup>Yet for loveâ€™s sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-10">10</sup>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-11">11</sup>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-12">12</sup>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-13">13</sup>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-14">14</sup>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-15">15</sup>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-16">16</sup>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-17">17</sup>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-18">18</sup>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-19">19</sup>I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-20">20</sup>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-21">21</sup>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-22">22</sup>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-23">23</sup>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-24">24</sup>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</p>
				<p><sup id="chapter-1-sup-25">25</sup>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
