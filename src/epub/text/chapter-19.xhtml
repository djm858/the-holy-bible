						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-078056">56</sup>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</span>

						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-078061">61</sup>And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemyâ€™s hand.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-078062">62</sup>He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</span>

						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-078064">64</sup>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-078065">65</sup>Then the <b>Lord</b> awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</span>
						<br/>

						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-078067">67</sup>Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-078068">68</sup>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-078069">69</sup>And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-078070">70</sup>He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</span>
