			<h2>Book 19 Psalms</h2>
			<p>19:001:001 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.</p>
			<p>19:001:002 But his delight is in the law of the <b>Lord</b>; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.</p>
			<p>19:001:003 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</p>
			<p>19:001:004 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.</p>
			<p>19:001:005 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</p>
			<p>19:001:006 For the <b>Lord</b> knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.</p>
			<p>19:002:001 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</p>
			<p>19:002:002 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the <b>Lord</b>, and against his anointed, saying,</p>
			<p>19:002:003 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</p>
			<p>19:002:004 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the <b>Lord</b> shall have them in derision.</p>
			<p>19:002:005 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</p>
			<p>19:002:006 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.</p>
			<p>19:002:007 I will declare the decree: the <b>Lord</b> hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.</p>
			<p>19:002:008 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.</p>
			<p>19:002:009 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.</p>
			<p>19:002:010 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.</p>
			<p>19:002:011 Serve the <b>Lord</b> with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</p>
			<p>19:002:012 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</p>
			<p>19:003:001 Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.</p>
			<p>19:003:002 Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:003:003 But thou, O <b>Lord</b>, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.</p>
			<p>19:003:004 I cried unto the <b>Lord</b> with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:003:005 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the <b>Lord</b> sustained me.</p>
			<p>19:003:006 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.</p>
			<p>19:003:007 Arise, O <b>Lord</b>; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.</p>
			<p>19:003:008 Salvation belongeth unto the <b>Lord</b>: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:004:001 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.</p>
			<p>19:004:002 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.</p>
			<p>19:004:003 But know that the <b>Lord</b> hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the <b>Lord</b> will hear when I call unto him.</p>
			<p>19:004:004 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:004:005 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:004:006 There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? <b>Lord</b>, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</p>
			<p>19:004:007 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.</p>
			<p>19:004:008 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, <b>Lord</b>, only makest me dwell in safety.</p>
			<p>19:005:001 Give ear to my words, O <b>Lord</b>, consider my meditation.</p>
			<p>19:005:002 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.</p>
			<p>19:005:003 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O <b>Lord</b>; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</p>
			<p>19:005:004 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.</p>
			<p>19:005:005 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.</p>
			<p>19:005:006 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the <b>Lord</b> will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.</p>
			<p>19:005:007 But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.</p>
			<p>19:005:008 Lead me, O <b>Lord</b>, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.</p>
			<p>19:005:009 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.</p>
			<p>19:005:010 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.</p>
			<p>19:005:011 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.</p>
			<p>19:005:012 For thou, <b>Lord</b>, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.</p>
			<p>19:006:001 O <b>Lord</b>, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</p>
			<p>19:006:002 Have mercy upon me, O <b>Lord</b>; for I am weak: O <b>Lord</b>, heal me; for my bones are vexed.</p>
			<p>19:006:003 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O <b>Lord</b>, how long?</p>
			<p>19:006:004 Return, O <b>Lord</b>, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies’ sake.</p>
			<p>19:006:005 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?</p>
			<p>19:006:006 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.</p>
			<p>19:006:007 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.</p>
			<p>19:006:008 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the <b>Lord</b> hath heard the voice of my weeping.</p>
			<p>19:006:009 The <b>Lord</b> hath heard my supplication; the <b>Lord</b> will receive my prayer.</p>
			<p>19:006:010 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return and be ashamed suddenly.</p>
			<p>19:007:001 O <b>Lord</b> my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:</p>
			<p>19:007:002 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.</p>
			<p>19:007:003 O <b>Lord</b> my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;</p>
			<p>19:007:004 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)</p>
			<p>19:007:005 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:007:006 Arise, O <b>Lord</b>, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.</p>
			<p>19:007:007 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.</p>
			<p>19:007:008 The <b>Lord</b> shall judge the people: judge me, O <b>Lord</b>, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.</p>
			<p>19:007:009 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.</p>
			<p>19:007:010 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.</p>
			<p>19:007:011 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.</p>
			<p>19:007:012 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.</p>
			<p>19:007:013 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.</p>
			<p>19:007:014 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.</p>
			<p>19:007:015 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.</p>
			<p>19:007:016 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.</p>
			<p>19:007:017 I will praise the <b>Lord</b> according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the <b>Lord</b> most high.</p>
			<p>19:008:001 O <b>Lord</b>, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.</p>
			<p>19:008:002 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.</p>
			<p>19:008:003 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;</p>
			<p>19:008:004 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?</p>
			<p>19:008:005 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.</p>
			<p>19:008:006 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:</p>
			<p>19:008:007 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;</p>
			<p>19:008:008 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.</p>
			<p>19:008:009 O <b>Lord</b> our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!</p>
			<p>19:009:001 I will praise thee, O <b>Lord</b>, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.</p>
			<p>19:009:002 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.</p>
			<p>19:009:003 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.</p>
			<p>19:009:004 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.</p>
			<p>19:009:005 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.</p>
			<p>19:009:006 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.</p>
			<p>19:009:007 But the <b>Lord</b> shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.</p>
			<p>19:009:008 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.</p>
			<p>19:009:009 The <b>Lord</b> also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.</p>
			<p>19:009:010 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, <b>Lord</b>, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.</p>
			<p>19:009:011 Sing praises to the <b>Lord</b>, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.</p>
			<p>19:009:012 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.</p>
			<p>19:009:013 Have mercy upon me, O <b>Lord</b>; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:</p>
			<p>19:009:014 That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.</p>
			<p>19:009:015 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.</p>
			<p>19:009:016 The <b>Lord</b> is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:009:017 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.</p>
			<p>19:009:018 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.</p>
			<p>19:009:019 Arise, O <b>Lord</b>; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.</p>
			<p>19:009:020 Put them in fear, O <b>Lord</b>: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:010:001 Why standest thou afar off, O <b>Lord</b>? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?</p>
			<p>19:010:002 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.</p>
			<p>19:010:003 For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the <b>Lord</b> abhorreth.</p>
			<p>19:010:004 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.</p>
			<p>19:010:005 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.</p>
			<p>19:010:006 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.</p>
			<p>19:010:007 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.</p>
			<p>19:010:008 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.</p>
			<p>19:010:009 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.</p>
			<p>19:010:010 He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.</p>
			<p>19:010:011 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.</p>
			<p>19:010:012 Arise, O <b>Lord</b>; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.</p>
			<p>19:010:013 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.</p>
			<p>19:010:014 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.</p>
			<p>19:010:015 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.</p>
			<p>19:010:016 The <b>Lord</b> is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.</p>
			<p>19:010:017 <b>Lord</b>, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:</p>
			<p>19:010:018 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.</p>
			<p>19:011:001 In the <b>Lord</b> put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?</p>
			<p>19:011:002 For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.</p>
			<p>19:011:003 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?</p>
			<p>19:011:004 The <b>Lord</b> is in his holy temple, the <b>Lord</b>’s throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.</p>
			<p>19:011:005 The <b>Lord</b> trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.</p>
			<p>19:011:006 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.</p>
			<p>19:011:007 For the righteous <b>Lord</b> loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.</p>
			<p>19:012:001 Help, <b>Lord</b>; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.</p>
			<p>19:012:002 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.</p>
			<p>19:012:003 The <b>Lord</b> shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:</p>
			<p>19:012:004 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?</p>
			<p>19:012:005 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the <b>Lord</b>; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.</p>
			<p>19:012:006 The words of the <b>Lord</b> are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.</p>
			<p>19:012:007 Thou shalt keep them, O <b>Lord</b>, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.</p>
			<p>19:012:008 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.</p>
			<p>19:013:001 How long wilt thou forget me, O <b>Lord</b>? for ever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?</p>
			<p>19:013:002 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?</p>
			<p>19:013:003 Consider and hear me, O <b>Lord</b> my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;</p>
			<p>19:013:004 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.</p>
			<p>19:013:005 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.</p>
			<p>19:013:006 I will sing unto the <b>Lord</b>, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.</p>
			<p>19:014:001 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.</p>
			<p>19:014:002 The <b>Lord</b> looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.</p>
			<p>19:014:003 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>
			<p>19:014:004 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:014:005 There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.</p>
			<p>19:014:006 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the <b>Lord</b> is his refuge.</p>
			<p>19:014:007 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the <b>Lord</b> bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</p>
			<p>19:015:001 Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill?</p>
			<p>19:015:002 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart.</p>
			<p>19:015:003 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.</p>
			<p>19:015:004 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the <b>Lord</b>. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not.</p>
			<p>19:015:005 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.</p>
			<p>19:016:001 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.</p>
			<p>19:016:002 O my soul, thou hast said unto the <b>Lord</b>, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee;</p>
			<p>19:016:003 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.</p>
			<p>19:016:004 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.</p>
			<p>19:016:005 The <b>Lord</b> is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.</p>
			<p>19:016:006 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.</p>
			<p>19:016:007 I will bless the <b>Lord</b>, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.</p>
			<p>19:016:008 I have set the <b>Lord</b> always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.</p>
			<p>19:016:009 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.</p>
			<p>19:016:010 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</p>
			<p>19:016:011 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.</p>
			<p>19:017:001 Hear the right, O <b>Lord</b>, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.</p>
			<p>19:017:002 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.</p>
			<p>19:017:003 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.</p>
			<p>19:017:004 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.</p>
			<p>19:017:005 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.</p>
			<p>19:017:006 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.</p>
			<p>19:017:007 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them.</p>
			<p>19:017:008 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,</p>
			<p>19:017:009 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.</p>
			<p>19:017:010 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.</p>
			<p>19:017:011 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;</p>
			<p>19:017:012 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.</p>
			<p>19:017:013 Arise, O <b>Lord</b>, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword:</p>
			<p>19:017:014 From men which are thy hand, O <b>Lord</b>, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.</p>
			<p>19:017:015 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.</p>
			<p>19:018:001 I will love thee, O <b>Lord</b>, my strength.</p>
			<p>19:018:002 The <b>Lord</b> is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.</p>
			<p>19:018:003 I will call upon the <b>Lord</b>, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</p>
			<p>19:018:004 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</p>
			<p>19:018:005 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.</p>
			<p>19:018:006 In my distress I called upon the <b>Lord</b>, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.</p>
			<p>19:018:007 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</p>
			<p>19:018:008 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</p>
			<p>19:018:009 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.</p>
			<p>19:018:010 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</p>
			<p>19:018:011 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</p>
			<p>19:018:012 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.</p>
			<p>19:018:013 The <b>Lord</b> also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.</p>
			<p>19:018:014 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</p>
			<p>19:018:015 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O <b>Lord</b>, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</p>
			<p>19:018:016 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</p>
			<p>19:018:017 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.</p>
			<p>19:018:018 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the <b>Lord</b> was my stay.</p>
			<p>19:018:019 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</p>
			<p>19:018:020 The <b>Lord</b> rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</p>
			<p>19:018:021 For I have kept the ways of the <b>Lord</b>, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</p>
			<p>19:018:022 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.</p>
			<p>19:018:023 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.</p>
			<p>19:018:024 Therefore hath the <b>Lord</b> recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</p>
			<p>19:018:025 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;</p>
			<p>19:018:026 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.</p>
			<p>19:018:027 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.</p>
			<p>19:018:028 For thou wilt light my candle: the <b>Lord</b> my God will enlighten my darkness.</p>
			<p>19:018:029 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.</p>
			<p>19:018:030 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the <b>Lord</b> is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.</p>
			<p>19:018:031 For who is God save the <b>Lord</b>? or who is a rock save our God?</p>
			<p>19:018:032 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</p>
			<p>19:018:033 He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, and setteth me upon my high places.</p>
			<p>19:018:034 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</p>
			<p>19:018:035 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</p>
			<p>19:018:036 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</p>
			<p>19:018:037 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</p>
			<p>19:018:038 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</p>
			<p>19:018:039 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</p>
			<p>19:018:040 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</p>
			<p>19:018:041 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the <b>Lord</b>, but he answered them not.</p>
			<p>19:018:042 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</p>
			<p>19:018:043 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.</p>
			<p>19:018:044 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.</p>
			<p>19:018:045 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.</p>
			<p>19:018:046 The <b>Lord</b> liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</p>
			<p>19:018:047 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</p>
			<p>19:018:048 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</p>
			<p>19:018:049 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O <b>Lord</b>, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.</p>
			<p>19:018:050 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</p>
			<p>19:019:001 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.</p>
			<p>19:019:002 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.</p>
			<p>19:019:003 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.</p>
			<p>19:019:004 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,</p>
			<p>19:019:005 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.</p>
			<p>19:019:006 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.</p>
			<p>19:019:007 The law of the <b>Lord</b> is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the <b>Lord</b> is sure, making wise the simple.</p>
			<p>19:019:008 The statutes of the <b>Lord</b> are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the <b>Lord</b> is pure, enlightening the eyes.</p>
			<p>19:019:009 The fear of the <b>Lord</b> is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the <b>Lord</b> are true and righteous altogether.</p>
			<p>19:019:010 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.</p>
			<p>19:019:011 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.</p>
			<p>19:019:012 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.</p>
			<p>19:019:013 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.</p>
			<p>19:019:014 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O <b>Lord</b>, my strength, and my redeemer.</p>
			<p>19:020:001 The <b>Lord</b> hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;</p>
			<p>19:020:002 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;</p>
			<p>19:020:003 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.</p>
			<p>19:020:004 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.</p>
			<p>19:020:005 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the <b>Lord</b> fulfil all thy petitions.</p>
			<p>19:020:006 Now know I that the <b>Lord</b> saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.</p>
			<p>19:020:007 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the <b>Lord</b> our God.</p>
			<p>19:020:008 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.</p>
			<p>19:020:009 Save, <b>Lord</b>: let the king hear us when we call.</p>
			<p>19:021:001 The king shall joy in thy strength, O <b>Lord</b>; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!</p>
			<p>19:021:002 Thou hast given him his heart’s desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:021:003 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.</p>
			<p>19:021:004 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.</p>
			<p>19:021:005 His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.</p>
			<p>19:021:006 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.</p>
			<p>19:021:007 For the king trusteth in the <b>Lord</b>, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.</p>
			<p>19:021:008 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.</p>
			<p>19:021:009 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the <b>Lord</b> shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.</p>
			<p>19:021:010 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.</p>
			<p>19:021:011 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.</p>
			<p>19:021:012 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.</p>
			<p>19:021:013 Be thou exalted, <b>Lord</b>, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power.</p>
			<p>19:022:001 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?</p>
			<p>19:022:002 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.</p>
			<p>19:022:003 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.</p>
			<p>19:022:004 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.</p>
			<p>19:022:005 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.</p>
			<p>19:022:006 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.</p>
			<p>19:022:007 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,</p>
			<p>19:022:008 He trusted on the <b>Lord</b> that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.</p>
			<p>19:022:009 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother’s breasts.</p>
			<p>19:022:010 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother’s belly.</p>
			<p>19:022:011 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.</p>
			<p>19:022:012 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.</p>
			<p>19:022:013 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.</p>
			<p>19:022:014 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.</p>
			<p>19:022:015 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.</p>
			<p>19:022:016 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.</p>
			<p>19:022:017 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.</p>
			<p>19:022:018 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.</p>
			<p>19:022:019 But be not thou far from me, O <b>Lord</b>: O my strength, haste thee to help me.</p>
			<p>19:022:020 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.</p>
			<p>19:022:021 Save me from the lion’s mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.</p>
			<p>19:022:022 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.</p>
			<p>19:022:023 Ye that fear the <b>Lord</b>, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.</p>
			<p>19:022:024 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.</p>
			<p>19:022:025 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.</p>
			<p>19:022:026 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the <b>Lord</b> that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.</p>
			<p>19:022:027 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the <b>Lord</b>: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.</p>
			<p>19:022:028 For the kingdom is the <b>Lord</b>’s: and he is the governor among the nations.</p>
			<p>19:022:029 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.</p>
			<p>19:022:030 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.</p>
			<p>19:022:031 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.</p>
			<p>19:023:001 The <b>Lord</b> is my shepherd; I shall not want.</p>
			<p>19:023:002 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.</p>
			<p>19:023:003 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.</p>
			<p>19:023:004 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</p>
			<p>19:023:005 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.</p>
			<p>19:023:006 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the <b>Lord</b> for ever.</p>
			<p>19:024:001 The earth is the <b>Lord</b>’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.</p>
			<p>19:024:002 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.</p>
			<p>19:024:003 Who shall ascend into the hill of the <b>Lord</b>? or who shall stand in his holy place?</p>
			<p>19:024:004 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.</p>
			<p>19:024:005 He shall receive the blessing from the <b>Lord</b>, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.</p>
			<p>19:024:006 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:024:007 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.</p>
			<p>19:024:008 Who is this King of glory? The <b>Lord</b> strong and mighty, the <b>Lord</b> mighty in battle.</p>
			<p>19:024:009 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.</p>
			<p>19:024:010 Who is this King of glory? The <b>Lord</b> of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:025:001 Unto thee, O <b>Lord</b>, do I lift up my soul.</p>
			<p>19:025:002 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.</p>
			<p>19:025:003 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.</p>
			<p>19:025:004 Shew me thy ways, O <b>Lord</b>; teach me thy paths.</p>
			<p>19:025:005 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.</p>
			<p>19:025:006 Remember, O <b>Lord</b>, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.</p>
			<p>19:025:007 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness’ sake, O <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:025:008 Good and upright is the <b>Lord</b>: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.</p>
			<p>19:025:009 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.</p>
			<p>19:025:010 All the paths of the <b>Lord</b> are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.</p>
			<p>19:025:011 For thy name’s sake, O <b>Lord</b>, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.</p>
			<p>19:025:012 What man is he that feareth the <b>Lord</b>? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.</p>
			<p>19:025:013 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.</p>
			<p>19:025:014 The secret of the <b>Lord</b> is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.</p>
			<p>19:025:015 Mine eyes are ever toward the <b>Lord</b>; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.</p>
			<p>19:025:016 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.</p>
			<p>19:025:017 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.</p>
			<p>19:025:018 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.</p>
			<p>19:025:019 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.</p>
			<p>19:025:020 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.</p>
			<p>19:025:021 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.</p>
			<p>19:025:022 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.</p>
			<p>19:026:001 Judge me, O <b>Lord</b>; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the <b>Lord</b>; therefore I shall not slide.</p>
			<p>19:026:002 Examine me, O <b>Lord</b>, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.</p>
			<p>19:026:003 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.</p>
			<p>19:026:004 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.</p>
			<p>19:026:005 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.</p>
			<p>19:026:006 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O <b>Lord</b>:</p>
			<p>19:026:007 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.</p>
			<p>19:026:008 <b>Lord</b>, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.</p>
			<p>19:026:009 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:</p>
			<p>19:026:010 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.</p>
			<p>19:026:011 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.</p>
			<p>19:026:012 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:027:001 The <b>Lord</b> is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the <b>Lord</b> is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?</p>
			<p>19:027:002 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.</p>
			<p>19:027:003 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.</p>
			<p>19:027:004 One thing have I desired of the <b>Lord</b>, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the <b>Lord</b> all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the <b>Lord</b>, and to enquire in his temple.</p>
			<p>19:027:005 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.</p>
			<p>19:027:006 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:027:007 Hear, O <b>Lord</b>, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.</p>
			<p>19:027:008 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, <b>Lord</b>, will I seek.</p>
			<p>19:027:009 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.</p>
			<p>19:027:010 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the <b>Lord</b> will take me up.</p>
			<p>19:027:011 Teach me thy way, O <b>Lord</b>, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.</p>
			<p>19:027:012 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.</p>
			<p>19:027:013 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the <b>Lord</b> in the land of the living.</p>
			<p>19:027:014 Wait on the <b>Lord</b>: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:028:001 Unto thee will I cry, O <b>Lord</b> my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.</p>
			<p>19:028:002 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.</p>
			<p>19:028:003 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts.</p>
			<p>19:028:004 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.</p>
			<p>19:028:005 Because they regard not the works of the <b>Lord</b>, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.</p>
			<p>19:028:006 Blessed be the <b>Lord</b>, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.</p>
			<p>19:028:007 The <b>Lord</b> is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.</p>
			<p>19:028:008 The <b>Lord</b> is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed.</p>
			<p>19:028:009 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.</p>
			<p>19:029:001 Give unto the <b>Lord</b>, O ye mighty, give unto the <b>Lord</b> glory and strength.</p>
			<p>19:029:002 Give unto the <b>Lord</b> the glory due unto his name; worship the <b>Lord</b> in the beauty of holiness.</p>
			<p>19:029:003 The voice of the <b>Lord</b> is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the <b>Lord</b> is upon many waters.</p>
			<p>19:029:004 The voice of the <b>Lord</b> is powerful; the voice of the <b>Lord</b> is full of majesty.</p>
			<p>19:029:005 The voice of the <b>Lord</b> breaketh the cedars; yea, the <b>Lord</b> breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.</p>
			<p>19:029:006 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn.</p>
			<p>19:029:007 The voice of the <b>Lord</b> divideth the flames of fire.</p>
			<p>19:029:008 The voice of the <b>Lord</b> shaketh the wilderness; the <b>Lord</b> shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh.</p>
			<p>19:029:009 The voice of the <b>Lord</b> maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.</p>
			<p>19:029:010 The <b>Lord</b> sitteth upon the flood; yea, the <b>Lord</b> sitteth King for ever.</p>
			<p>19:029:011 The <b>Lord</b> will give strength unto his people; the <b>Lord</b> will bless his people with peace.</p>
			<p>19:030:001 I will extol thee, O <b>Lord</b>; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.</p>
			<p>19:030:002 O <b>Lord</b> my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.</p>
			<p>19:030:003 O <b>Lord</b>, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.</p>
			<p>19:030:004 Sing unto the <b>Lord</b>, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.</p>
			<p>19:030:005 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.</p>
			<p>19:030:006 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.</p>
			<p>19:030:007 <b>Lord</b>, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.</p>
			<p>19:030:008 I cried to thee, O <b>Lord</b>; and unto the <b>Lord</b> I made supplication.</p>
			<p>19:030:009 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?</p>
			<p>19:030:010 Hear, O <b>Lord</b>, and have mercy upon me: <b>Lord</b>, be thou my helper.</p>
			<p>19:030:011 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;</p>
			<p>19:030:012 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O <b>Lord</b> my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.</p>
			<p>19:031:001 In thee, O <b>Lord</b>, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.</p>
			<p>19:031:002 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.</p>
			<p>19:031:003 For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name’s sake lead me, and guide me.</p>
			<p>19:031:004 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength.</p>
			<p>19:031:005 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O <b>Lord</b> God of truth.</p>
			<p>19:031:006 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:031:007 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;</p>
			<p>19:031:008 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.</p>
			<p>19:031:009 Have mercy upon me, O <b>Lord</b>, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.</p>
			<p>19:031:010 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.</p>
			<p>19:031:011 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.</p>
			<p>19:031:012 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.</p>
			<p>19:031:013 For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.</p>
			<p>19:031:014 But I trusted in thee, O <b>Lord</b>: I said, Thou art my God.</p>
			<p>19:031:015 My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.</p>
			<p>19:031:016 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies’ sake.</p>
			<p>19:031:017 Let me not be ashamed, O <b>Lord</b>; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.</p>
			<p>19:031:018 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.</p>
			<p>19:031:019 Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!</p>
			<p>19:031:020 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.</p>
			<p>19:031:021 Blessed be the <b>Lord</b>: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.</p>
			<p>19:031:022 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.</p>
			<p>19:031:023 O love the <b>Lord</b>, all ye his saints: for the <b>Lord</b> preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.</p>
			<p>19:031:024 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:032:001 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.</p>
			<p>19:032:002 Blessed is the man unto whom the <b>Lord</b> imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.</p>
			<p>19:032:003 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.</p>
			<p>19:032:004 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:032:005 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the <b>Lord</b>; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:032:006 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.</p>
			<p>19:032:007 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:032:008 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.</p>
			<p>19:032:009 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.</p>
			<p>19:032:010 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the <b>Lord</b>, mercy shall compass him about.</p>
			<p>19:032:011 Be glad in the <b>Lord</b>, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.</p>
			<p>19:033:001 Rejoice in the <b>Lord</b>, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright.</p>
			<p>19:033:002 Praise the <b>Lord</b> with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.</p>
			<p>19:033:003 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.</p>
			<p>19:033:004 For the word of the <b>Lord</b> is right; and all his works are done in truth.</p>
			<p>19:033:005 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:033:006 By the word of the <b>Lord</b> were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.</p>
			<p>19:033:007 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.</p>
			<p>19:033:008 Let all the earth fear the <b>Lord</b>: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.</p>
			<p>19:033:009 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.</p>
			<p>19:033:010 The <b>Lord</b> bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.</p>
			<p>19:033:011 The counsel of the <b>Lord</b> standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</p>
			<p>19:033:012 Blessed is the nation whose God is the <b>Lord</b>; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.</p>
			<p>19:033:013 The <b>Lord</b> looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.</p>
			<p>19:033:014 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.</p>
			<p>19:033:015 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.</p>
			<p>19:033:016 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.</p>
			<p>19:033:017 An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.</p>
			<p>19:033:018 Behold, the eye of the <b>Lord</b> is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;</p>
			<p>19:033:019 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.</p>
			<p>19:033:020 Our soul waiteth for the <b>Lord</b>: he is our help and our shield.</p>
			<p>19:033:021 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.</p>
			<p>19:033:022 Let thy mercy, O <b>Lord</b>, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.</p>
			<p>19:034:001 I will bless the <b>Lord</b> at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.</p>
			<p>19:034:002 My soul shall make her boast in the <b>Lord</b>: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.</p>
			<p>19:034:003 O magnify the <b>Lord</b> with me, and let us exalt his name together.</p>
			<p>19:034:004 I sought the <b>Lord</b>, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.</p>
			<p>19:034:005 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.</p>
			<p>19:034:006 This poor man cried, and the <b>Lord</b> heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.</p>
			<p>19:034:007 The angel of the <b>Lord</b> encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</p>
			<p>19:034:008 O taste and see that the <b>Lord</b> is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.</p>
			<p>19:034:009 O fear the <b>Lord</b>, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.</p>
			<p>19:034:010 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the <b>Lord</b> shall not want any good thing.</p>
			<p>19:034:011 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:034:012 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?</p>
			<p>19:034:013 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.</p>
			<p>19:034:014 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.</p>
			<p>19:034:015 The eyes of the <b>Lord</b> are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.</p>
			<p>19:034:016 The face of the <b>Lord</b> is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</p>
			<p>19:034:017 The righteous cry, and the <b>Lord</b> heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.</p>
			<p>19:034:018 The <b>Lord</b> is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.</p>
			<p>19:034:019 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the <b>Lord</b> delivereth him out of them all.</p>
			<p>19:034:020 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.</p>
			<p>19:034:021 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.</p>
			<p>19:034:022 The <b>Lord</b> redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.</p>
			<p>19:035:001 Plead my cause, O <b>Lord</b>, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me.</p>
			<p>19:035:002 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.</p>
			<p>19:035:003 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.</p>
			<p>19:035:004 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.</p>
			<p>19:035:005 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the <b>Lord</b> chase them.</p>
			<p>19:035:006 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the <b>Lord</b> persecute them.</p>
			<p>19:035:007 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul.</p>
			<p>19:035:008 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.</p>
			<p>19:035:009 And my soul shall be joyful in the <b>Lord</b>: it shall rejoice in his salvation.</p>
			<p>19:035:010 All my bones shall say, <b>Lord</b>, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?</p>
			<p>19:035:011 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not.</p>
			<p>19:035:012 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.</p>
			<p>19:035:013 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom.</p>
			<p>19:035:014 I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.</p>
			<p>19:035:015 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:</p>
			<p>19:035:016 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.</p>
			<p>19:035:017 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.</p>
			<p>19:035:018 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praise thee among much people.</p>
			<p>19:035:019 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.</p>
			<p>19:035:020 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land.</p>
			<p>19:035:021 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.</p>
			<p>19:035:022 This thou hast seen, O <b>Lord</b>: keep not silence: O Lord, be not far from me.</p>
			<p>19:035:023 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.</p>
			<p>19:035:024 Judge me, O <b>Lord</b> my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.</p>
			<p>19:035:025 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let them not say, We have swallowed him up.</p>
			<p>19:035:026 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me.</p>
			<p>19:035:027 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the <b>Lord</b> be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.</p>
			<p>19:035:028 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.</p>
			<p>19:036:001 The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.</p>
			<p>19:036:002 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.</p>
			<p>19:036:003 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good.</p>
			<p>19:036:004 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.</p>
			<p>19:036:005 Thy mercy, O <b>Lord</b>, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.</p>
			<p>19:036:006 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O <b>Lord</b>, thou preservest man and beast.</p>
			<p>19:036:007 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.</p>
			<p>19:036:008 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.</p>
			<p>19:036:009 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.</p>
			<p>19:036:010 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.</p>
			<p>19:036:011 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.</p>
			<p>19:036:012 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.</p>
			<p>19:037:001 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.</p>
			<p>19:037:002 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.</p>
			<p>19:037:003 Trust in the <b>Lord</b>, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.</p>
			<p>19:037:004 Delight thyself also in the <b>Lord</b>: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.</p>
			<p>19:037:005 Commit thy way unto the <b>Lord</b>; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.</p>
			<p>19:037:006 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.</p>
			<p>19:037:007 Rest in the <b>Lord</b>, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.</p>
			<p>19:037:008 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.</p>
			<p>19:037:009 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the <b>Lord</b>, they shall inherit the earth.</p>
			<p>19:037:010 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.</p>
			<p>19:037:011 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</p>
			<p>19:037:012 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.</p>
			<p>19:037:013 The <b>Lord</b> shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.</p>
			<p>19:037:014 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.</p>
			<p>19:037:015 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.</p>
			<p>19:037:016 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.</p>
			<p>19:037:017 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the <b>Lord</b> upholdeth the righteous.</p>
			<p>19:037:018 The <b>Lord</b> knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.</p>
			<p>19:037:019 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</p>
			<p>19:037:020 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the <b>Lord</b> shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.</p>
			<p>19:037:021 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.</p>
			<p>19:037:022 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.</p>
			<p>19:037:023 The steps of a good man are ordered by the <b>Lord</b>: and he delighteth in his way.</p>
			<p>19:037:024 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the <b>Lord</b> upholdeth him with his hand.</p>
			<p>19:037:025 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.</p>
			<p>19:037:026 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.</p>
			<p>19:037:027 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.</p>
			<p>19:037:028 For the <b>Lord</b> loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>
			<p>19:037:029 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.</p>
			<p>19:037:030 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.</p>
			<p>19:037:031 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.</p>
			<p>19:037:032 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.</p>
			<p>19:037:033 The <b>Lord</b> will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.</p>
			<p>19:037:034 Wait on the <b>Lord</b>, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.</p>
			<p>19:037:035 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.</p>
			<p>19:037:036 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.</p>
			<p>19:037:037 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.</p>
			<p>19:037:038 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.</p>
			<p>19:037:039 But the salvation of the righteous is of the <b>Lord</b>: he is their strength in the time of trouble.</p>
			<p>19:037:040 And the <b>Lord</b> shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.</p>
			<p>19:038:001 O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</p>
			<p>19:038:002 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.</p>
			<p>19:038:003 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.</p>
			<p>19:038:004 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</p>
			<p>19:038:005 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.</p>
			<p>19:038:006 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.</p>
			<p>19:038:007 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.</p>
			<p>19:038:008 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.</p>
			<p>19:038:009 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.</p>
			<p>19:038:010 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.</p>
			<p>19:038:011 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.</p>
			<p>19:038:012 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.</p>
			<p>19:038:013 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.</p>
			<p>19:038:014 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.</p>
			<p>19:038:015 For in thee, O <b>Lord</b>, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.</p>
			<p>19:038:016 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.</p>
			<p>19:038:017 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.</p>
			<p>19:038:018 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.</p>
			<p>19:038:019 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</p>
			<p>19:038:020 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.</p>
			<p>19:038:021 Forsake me not, O <b>Lord</b>: O my God, be not far from me.</p>
			<p>19:038:022 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.</p>
			<p>19:039:001 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.</p>
			<p>19:039:002 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.</p>
			<p>19:039:003 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,</p>
			<p>19:039:004 <b>Lord</b>, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is: that I may know how frail I am.</p>
			<p>19:039:005 Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:039:006 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.</p>
			<p>19:039:007 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.</p>
			<p>19:039:008 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.</p>
			<p>19:039:009 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.</p>
			<p>19:039:010 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.</p>
			<p>19:039:011 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:039:012 Hear my prayer, O <b>Lord</b>, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.</p>
			<p>19:039:013 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.</p>
			<p>19:040:001 I waited patiently for the <b>Lord</b>; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.</p>
			<p>19:040:002 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.</p>
			<p>19:040:003 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:040:004 Blessed is that man that maketh the <b>Lord</b> his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.</p>
			<p>19:040:005 Many, O <b>Lord</b> my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.</p>
			<p>19:040:006 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.</p>
			<p>19:040:007 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,</p>
			<p>19:040:008 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.</p>
			<p>19:040:009 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O <b>Lord</b>, thou knowest.</p>
			<p>19:040:010 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.</p>
			<p>19:040:011 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O <b>Lord</b>: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.</p>
			<p>19:040:012 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.</p>
			<p>19:040:013 Be pleased, O <b>Lord</b>, to deliver me: O <b>Lord</b>, make haste to help me.</p>
			<p>19:040:014 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.</p>
			<p>19:040:015 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.</p>
			<p>19:040:016 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The <b>Lord</b> be magnified.</p>
			<p>19:040:017 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.</p>
			<p>19:041:001 Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the <b>Lord</b> will deliver him in time of trouble.</p>
			<p>19:041:002 The <b>Lord</b> will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.</p>
			<p>19:041:003 The <b>Lord</b> will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.</p>
			<p>19:041:004 I said, <b>Lord</b>, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.</p>
			<p>19:041:005 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?</p>
			<p>19:041:006 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.</p>
			<p>19:041:007 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.</p>
			<p>19:041:008 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.</p>
			<p>19:041:009 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.</p>
			<p>19:041:010 But thou, O <b>Lord</b>, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.</p>
			<p>19:041:011 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.</p>
			<p>19:041:012 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.</p>
			<p>19:041:013 Blessed be the <b>Lord</b> God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.</p>
			<p>19:042:001 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.</p>
			<p>19:042:002 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?</p>
			<p>19:042:003 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?</p>
			<p>19:042:004 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.</p>
			<p>19:042:005 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.</p>
			<p>19:042:006 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar.</p>
			<p>19:042:007 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.</p>
			<p>19:042:008 Yet the <b>Lord</b> will command his lovingkindness in the day time, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life.</p>
			<p>19:042:009 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?</p>
			<p>19:042:010 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?</p>
			<p>19:042:011 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.</p>
			<p>19:043:001 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.</p>
			<p>19:043:002 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?</p>
			<p>19:043:003 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.</p>
			<p>19:043:004 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.</p>
			<p>19:043:005 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.</p>
			<p>19:044:001 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.</p>
			<p>19:044:002 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.</p>
			<p>19:044:003 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.</p>
			<p>19:044:004 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.</p>
			<p>19:044:005 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.</p>
			<p>19:044:006 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.</p>
			<p>19:044:007 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.</p>
			<p>19:044:008 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:044:009 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.</p>
			<p>19:044:010 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.</p>
			<p>19:044:011 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.</p>
			<p>19:044:012 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price.</p>
			<p>19:044:013 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.</p>
			<p>19:044:014 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.</p>
			<p>19:044:015 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,</p>
			<p>19:044:016 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.</p>
			<p>19:044:017 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.</p>
			<p>19:044:018 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;</p>
			<p>19:044:019 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.</p>
			<p>19:044:020 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;</p>
			<p>19:044:021 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.</p>
			<p>19:044:022 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</p>
			<p>19:044:023 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.</p>
			<p>19:044:024 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?</p>
			<p>19:044:025 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.</p>
			<p>19:044:026 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies’ sake.</p>
			<p>19:045:001 My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.</p>
			<p>19:045:002 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.</p>
			<p>19:045:003 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.</p>
			<p>19:045:004 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.</p>
			<p>19:045:005 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king’s enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.</p>
			<p>19:045:006 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.</p>
			<p>19:045:007 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</p>
			<p>19:045:008 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.</p>
			<p>19:045:009 Kings’ daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.</p>
			<p>19:045:010 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house;</p>
			<p>19:045:011 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.</p>
			<p>19:045:012 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.</p>
			<p>19:045:013 The king’s daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.</p>
			<p>19:045:014 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.</p>
			<p>19:045:015 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king’s palace.</p>
			<p>19:045:016 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.</p>
			<p>19:045:017 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.</p>
			<p>19:046:001 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.</p>
			<p>19:046:002 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;</p>
			<p>19:046:003 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:046:004 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.</p>
			<p>19:046:005 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.</p>
			<p>19:046:006 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.</p>
			<p>19:046:007 The <b>Lord</b> of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:046:008 Come, behold the works of the <b>Lord</b>, what desolations he hath made in the earth.</p>
			<p>19:046:009 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.</p>
			<p>19:046:010 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.</p>
			<p>19:046:011 The <b>Lord</b> of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:047:001 O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.</p>
			<p>19:047:002 For the <b>Lord</b> most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth.</p>
			<p>19:047:003 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.</p>
			<p>19:047:004 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:047:005 God is gone up with a shout, the <b>Lord</b> with the sound of a trumpet.</p>
			<p>19:047:006 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises.</p>
			<p>19:047:007 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding.</p>
			<p>19:047:008 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness.</p>
			<p>19:047:009 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.</p>
			<p>19:048:001 Great is the <b>Lord</b>, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness.</p>
			<p>19:048:002 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.</p>
			<p>19:048:003 God is known in her palaces for a refuge.</p>
			<p>19:048:004 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.</p>
			<p>19:048:005 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away.</p>
			<p>19:048:006 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.</p>
			<p>19:048:007 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.</p>
			<p>19:048:008 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the <b>Lord</b> of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:048:009 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.</p>
			<p>19:048:010 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.</p>
			<p>19:048:011 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.</p>
			<p>19:048:012 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.</p>
			<p>19:048:013 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.</p>
			<p>19:048:014 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.</p>
			<p>19:049:001 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:</p>
			<p>19:049:002 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.</p>
			<p>19:049:003 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.</p>
			<p>19:049:004 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.</p>
			<p>19:049:005 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?</p>
			<p>19:049:006 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;</p>
			<p>19:049:007 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:</p>
			<p>19:049:008 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)</p>
			<p>19:049:009 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.</p>
			<p>19:049:010 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.</p>
			<p>19:049:011 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.</p>
			<p>19:049:012 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.</p>
			<p>19:049:013 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:049:014 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.</p>
			<p>19:049:015 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:049:016 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;</p>
			<p>19:049:017 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.</p>
			<p>19:049:018 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.</p>
			<p>19:049:019 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.</p>
			<p>19:049:020 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.</p>
			<p>19:050:001 The mighty God, even the <b>Lord</b>, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.</p>
			<p>19:050:002 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.</p>
			<p>19:050:003 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.</p>
			<p>19:050:004 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.</p>
			<p>19:050:005 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.</p>
			<p>19:050:006 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:050:007 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.</p>
			<p>19:050:008 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.</p>
			<p>19:050:009 I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds.</p>
			<p>19:050:010 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.</p>
			<p>19:050:011 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.</p>
			<p>19:050:012 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.</p>
			<p>19:050:013 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?</p>
			<p>19:050:014 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:</p>
			<p>19:050:015 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</p>
			<p>19:050:016 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?</p>
			<p>19:050:017 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind thee.</p>
			<p>19:050:018 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.</p>
			<p>19:050:019 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.</p>
			<p>19:050:020 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother’s son.</p>
			<p>19:050:021 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.</p>
			<p>19:050:022 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</p>
			<p>19:050:023 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.</p>
			<p>19:051:001 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.</p>
			<p>19:051:002 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.</p>
			<p>19:051:003 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.</p>
			<p>19:051:004 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.</p>
			<p>19:051:005 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.</p>
			<p>19:051:006 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.</p>
			<p>19:051:007 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</p>
			<p>19:051:008 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.</p>
			<p>19:051:009 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.</p>
			<p>19:051:010 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.</p>
			<p>19:051:011 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.</p>
			<p>19:051:012 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit.</p>
			<p>19:051:013 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.</p>
			<p>19:051:014 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.</p>
			<p>19:051:015 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.</p>
			<p>19:051:016 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.</p>
			<p>19:051:017 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.</p>
			<p>19:051:018 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.</p>
			<p>19:051:019 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.</p>
			<p>19:052:001 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God endureth continually.</p>
			<p>19:052:002 The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.</p>
			<p>19:052:003 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:052:004 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.</p>
			<p>19:052:005 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:052:006 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:</p>
			<p>19:052:007 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.</p>
			<p>19:052:008 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever.</p>
			<p>19:052:009 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.</p>
			<p>19:053:001 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.</p>
			<p>19:053:002 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.</p>
			<p>19:053:003 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>
			<p>19:053:004 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.</p>
			<p>19:053:005 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.</p>
			<p>19:053:006 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</p>
			<p>19:054:001 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.</p>
			<p>19:054:002 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.</p>
			<p>19:054:003 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:054:004 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.</p>
			<p>19:054:005 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.</p>
			<p>19:054:006 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O <b>Lord</b>; for it is good.</p>
			<p>19:054:007 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.</p>
			<p>19:055:001 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.</p>
			<p>19:055:002 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;</p>
			<p>19:055:003 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.</p>
			<p>19:055:004 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.</p>
			<p>19:055:005 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.</p>
			<p>19:055:006 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.</p>
			<p>19:055:007 Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:055:008 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.</p>
			<p>19:055:009 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</p>
			<p>19:055:010 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.</p>
			<p>19:055:011 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.</p>
			<p>19:055:012 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:</p>
			<p>19:055:013 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.</p>
			<p>19:055:014 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.</p>
			<p>19:055:015 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.</p>
			<p>19:055:016 As for me, I will call upon God; and the <b>Lord</b> shall save me.</p>
			<p>19:055:017 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.</p>
			<p>19:055:018 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.</p>
			<p>19:055:019 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.</p>
			<p>19:055:020 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.</p>
			<p>19:055:021 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.</p>
			<p>19:055:022 Cast thy burden upon the <b>Lord</b>, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.</p>
			<p>19:055:023 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.</p>
			<p>19:056:001 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.</p>
			<p>19:056:002 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High.</p>
			<p>19:056:003 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.</p>
			<p>19:056:004 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.</p>
			<p>19:056:005 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil.</p>
			<p>19:056:006 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.</p>
			<p>19:056:007 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God.</p>
			<p>19:056:008 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?</p>
			<p>19:056:009 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me.</p>
			<p>19:056:010 In God will I praise his word: in the <b>Lord</b> will I praise his word.</p>
			<p>19:056:011 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.</p>
			<p>19:056:012 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.</p>
			<p>19:056:013 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?</p>
			<p>19:057:001 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.</p>
			<p>19:057:002 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me.</p>
			<p>19:057:003 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.</p>
			<p>19:057:004 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.</p>
			<p>19:057:005 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.</p>
			<p>19:057:006 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:057:007 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.</p>
			<p>19:057:008 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.</p>
			<p>19:057:009 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto thee among the nations.</p>
			<p>19:057:010 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.</p>
			<p>19:057:011 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth.</p>
			<p>19:058:001 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?</p>
			<p>19:058:002 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.</p>
			<p>19:058:003 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.</p>
			<p>19:058:004 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;</p>
			<p>19:058:005 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.</p>
			<p>19:058:006 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:058:007 Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.</p>
			<p>19:058:008 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.</p>
			<p>19:058:009 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.</p>
			<p>19:058:010 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.</p>
			<p>19:058:011 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.</p>
			<p>19:059:001 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.</p>
			<p>19:059:002 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.</p>
			<p>19:059:003 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:059:004 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold.</p>
			<p>19:059:005 Thou therefore, O <b>Lord</b> God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:059:006 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.</p>
			<p>19:059:007 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?</p>
			<p>19:059:008 But thou, O <b>Lord</b>, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.</p>
			<p>19:059:009 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence.</p>
			<p>19:059:010 The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.</p>
			<p>19:059:011 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.</p>
			<p>19:059:012 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak.</p>
			<p>19:059:013 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:059:014 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.</p>
			<p>19:059:015 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.</p>
			<p>19:059:016 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.</p>
			<p>19:059:017 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.</p>
			<p>19:060:001 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.</p>
			<p>19:060:002 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.</p>
			<p>19:060:003 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.</p>
			<p>19:060:004 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:060:005 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me.</p>
			<p>19:060:006 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.</p>
			<p>19:060:007 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;</p>
			<p>19:060:008 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.</p>
			<p>19:060:009 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?</p>
			<p>19:060:010 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies?</p>
			<p>19:060:011 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.</p>
			<p>19:060:012 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.</p>
			<p>19:061:001 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.</p>
			<p>19:061:002 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.</p>
			<p>19:061:003 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.</p>
			<p>19:061:004 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:061:005 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.</p>
			<p>19:061:006 Thou wilt prolong the king’s life: and his years as many generations.</p>
			<p>19:061:007 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.</p>
			<p>19:061:008 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.</p>
			<p>19:062:001 Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.</p>
			<p>19:062:002 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.</p>
			<p>19:062:003 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.</p>
			<p>19:062:004 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:062:005 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.</p>
			<p>19:062:006 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.</p>
			<p>19:062:007 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.</p>
			<p>19:062:008 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:062:009 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.</p>
			<p>19:062:010 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.</p>
			<p>19:062:011 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.</p>
			<p>19:062:012 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.</p>
			<p>19:063:001 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;</p>
			<p>19:063:002 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.</p>
			<p>19:063:003 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.</p>
			<p>19:063:004 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.</p>
			<p>19:063:005 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:</p>
			<p>19:063:006 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.</p>
			<p>19:063:007 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.</p>
			<p>19:063:008 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.</p>
			<p>19:063:009 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.</p>
			<p>19:063:010 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.</p>
			<p>19:063:011 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.</p>
			<p>19:064:001 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.</p>
			<p>19:064:002 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:</p>
			<p>19:064:003 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:</p>
			<p>19:064:004 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.</p>
			<p>19:064:005 They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?</p>
			<p>19:064:006 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.</p>
			<p>19:064:007 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.</p>
			<p>19:064:008 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.</p>
			<p>19:064:009 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.</p>
			<p>19:064:010 The righteous shall be glad in the <b>Lord</b>, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.</p>
			<p>19:065:001 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed.</p>
			<p>19:065:002 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.</p>
			<p>19:065:003 Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.</p>
			<p>19:065:004 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.</p>
			<p>19:065:005 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:</p>
			<p>19:065:006 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power:</p>
			<p>19:065:007 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.</p>
			<p>19:065:008 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.</p>
			<p>19:065:009 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.</p>
			<p>19:065:010 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.</p>
			<p>19:065:011 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.</p>
			<p>19:065:012 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.</p>
			<p>19:065:013 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.</p>
			<p>19:066:001 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:</p>
			<p>19:066:002 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.</p>
			<p>19:066:003 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.</p>
			<p>19:066:004 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:066:005 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.</p>
			<p>19:066:006 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.</p>
			<p>19:066:007 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:066:008 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:</p>
			<p>19:066:009 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.</p>
			<p>19:066:010 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.</p>
			<p>19:066:011 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.</p>
			<p>19:066:012 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.</p>
			<p>19:066:013 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,</p>
			<p>19:066:014 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.</p>
			<p>19:066:015 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:066:016 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.</p>
			<p>19:066:017 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.</p>
			<p>19:066:018 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:</p>
			<p>19:066:019 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.</p>
			<p>19:066:020 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.</p>
			<p>19:067:001 God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah.</p>
			<p>19:067:002 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.</p>
			<p>19:067:003 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.</p>
			<p>19:067:004 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:067:005 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise thee.</p>
			<p>19:067:006 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own God, shall bless us.</p>
			<p>19:067:007 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.</p>
			<p>19:068:001 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.</p>
			<p>19:068:002 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.</p>
			<p>19:068:003 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.</p>
			<p>19:068:004 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name <b>Jah</b>, and rejoice before him.</p>
			<p>19:068:005 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.</p>
			<p>19:068:006 God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.</p>
			<p>19:068:007 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:</p>
			<p>19:068:008 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.</p>
			<p>19:068:009 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.</p>
			<p>19:068:010 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.</p>
			<p>19:068:011 The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.</p>
			<p>19:068:012 Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.</p>
			<p>19:068:013 Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.</p>
			<p>19:068:014 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon.</p>
			<p>19:068:015 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan.</p>
			<p>19:068:016 Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the <b>Lord</b> will dwell in it for ever.</p>
			<p>19:068:017 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.</p>
			<p>19:068:018 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the <b>Lord</b> God might dwell among them.</p>
			<p>19:068:019 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:068:020 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto <b>God</b> the Lord belong the issues from death.</p>
			<p>19:068:021 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.</p>
			<p>19:068:022 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea:</p>
			<p>19:068:023 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same.</p>
			<p>19:068:024 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.</p>
			<p>19:068:025 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.</p>
			<p>19:068:026 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.</p>
			<p>19:068:027 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.</p>
			<p>19:068:028 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.</p>
			<p>19:068:029 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.</p>
			<p>19:068:030 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in war.</p>
			<p>19:068:031 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.</p>
			<p>19:068:032 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:</p>
			<p>19:068:033 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.</p>
			<p>19:068:034 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds.</p>
			<p>19:068:035 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.</p>
			<p>19:069:001 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.</p>
			<p>19:069:002 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</p>
			<p>19:069:003 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</p>
			<p>19:069:004 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.</p>
			<p>19:069:005 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.</p>
			<p>19:069:006 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord <b>God</b> of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.</p>
			<p>19:069:007 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.</p>
			<p>19:069:008 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children.</p>
			<p>19:069:009 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</p>
			<p>19:069:010 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</p>
			<p>19:069:011 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.</p>
			<p>19:069:012 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.</p>
			<p>19:069:013 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O <b>Lord</b>, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.</p>
			<p>19:069:014 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</p>
			<p>19:069:015 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</p>
			<p>19:069:016 Hear me, O <b>Lord</b>; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</p>
			<p>19:069:017 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.</p>
			<p>19:069:018 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.</p>
			<p>19:069:019 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.</p>
			<p>19:069:020 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.</p>
			<p>19:069:021 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</p>
			<p>19:069:022 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.</p>
			<p>19:069:023 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.</p>
			<p>19:069:024 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.</p>
			<p>19:069:025 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.</p>
			<p>19:069:026 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.</p>
			<p>19:069:027 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.</p>
			<p>19:069:028 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</p>
			<p>19:069:029 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.</p>
			<p>19:069:030 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</p>
			<p>19:069:031 This also shall please the <b>Lord</b> better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</p>
			<p>19:069:032 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.</p>
			<p>19:069:033 For the <b>Lord</b> heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.</p>
			<p>19:069:034 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.</p>
			<p>19:069:035 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.</p>
			<p>19:069:036 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.</p>
			<h5>19:070:001 MAKE HASTE, O <b>God</b>, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O <b>Lord</b>.</h5>
			<p>19:070:002 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.</p>
			<p>19:070:003 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.</p>
			<p>19:070:004 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.</p>
			<p>19:070:005 But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O <b>Lord</b>, make no tarrying.</p>
			<p>19:071:001 In thee, O <b>Lord</b>, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.</p>
			<p>19:071:002 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.</p>
			<p>19:071:003 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress.</p>
			<p>19:071:004 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.</p>
			<p>19:071:005 For thou art my hope, O Lord <b>God</b>: thou art my trust from my youth.</p>
			<p>19:071:006 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother’s bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee.</p>
			<p>19:071:007 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.</p>
			<p>19:071:008 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day.</p>
			<p>19:071:009 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.</p>
			<p>19:071:010 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,</p>
			<p>19:071:011 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.</p>
			<p>19:071:012 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.</p>
			<p>19:071:013 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.</p>
			<p>19:071:014 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.</p>
			<p>19:071:015 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.</p>
			<p>19:071:016 I will go in the strength of the Lord <b>God</b>: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.</p>
			<p>19:071:017 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.</p>
			<p>19:071:018 Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.</p>
			<p>19:071:019 Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee!</p>
			<p>19:071:020 Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.</p>
			<p>19:071:021 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.</p>
			<p>19:071:022 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.</p>
			<p>19:071:023 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.</p>
			<p>19:071:024 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.</p>
			<p>19:072:001 Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king’s son.</p>
			<p>19:072:002 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.</p>
			<p>19:072:003 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.</p>
			<p>19:072:004 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.</p>
			<p>19:072:005 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.</p>
			<p>19:072:006 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.</p>
			<p>19:072:007 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.</p>
			<p>19:072:008 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.</p>
			<p>19:072:009 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.</p>
			<p>19:072:010 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.</p>
			<p>19:072:011 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.</p>
			<p>19:072:012 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.</p>
			<p>19:072:013 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.</p>
			<p>19:072:014 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.</p>
			<p>19:072:015 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.</p>
			<p>19:072:016 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.</p>
			<p>19:072:017 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.</p>
			<p>19:072:018 Blessed be the <b>Lord</b> God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.</p>
			<p>19:072:019 And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.</p>
			<p>19:072:020 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.</p>
			<p>19:073:001 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.</p>
			<p>19:073:002 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.</p>
			<p>19:073:003 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</p>
			<p>19:073:004 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.</p>
			<p>19:073:005 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.</p>
			<p>19:073:006 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.</p>
			<p>19:073:007 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.</p>
			<p>19:073:008 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.</p>
			<p>19:073:009 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.</p>
			<p>19:073:010 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.</p>
			<p>19:073:011 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?</p>
			<p>19:073:012 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.</p>
			<p>19:073:013 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.</p>
			<p>19:073:014 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.</p>
			<p>19:073:015 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.</p>
			<p>19:073:016 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;</p>
			<p>19:073:017 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.</p>
			<p>19:073:018 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.</p>
			<p>19:073:019 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.</p>
			<p>19:073:020 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.</p>
			<p>19:073:021 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.</p>
			<p>19:073:022 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.</p>
			<p>19:073:023 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.</p>
			<p>19:073:024 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.</p>
			<p>19:073:025 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.</p>
			<p>19:073:026 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</p>
			<p>19:073:027 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</p>
			<p>19:073:028 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord <b>God</b>, that I may declare all thy works.</p>
			<p>19:074:001 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?</p>
			<p>19:074:002 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.</p>
			<p>19:074:003 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.</p>
			<p>19:074:004 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.</p>
			<p>19:074:005 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.</p>
			<p>19:074:006 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.</p>
			<p>19:074:007 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.</p>
			<p>19:074:008 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.</p>
			<p>19:074:009 We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.</p>
			<p>19:074:010 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?</p>
			<p>19:074:011 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom.</p>
			<p>19:074:012 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.</p>
			<p>19:074:013 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.</p>
			<p>19:074:014 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.</p>
			<p>19:074:015 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.</p>
			<p>19:074:016 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.</p>
			<p>19:074:017 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.</p>
			<p>19:074:018 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O <b>Lord</b>, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.</p>
			<p>19:074:019 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.</p>
			<p>19:074:020 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.</p>
			<p>19:074:021 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.</p>
			<p>19:074:022 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.</p>
			<p>19:074:023 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.</p>
			<p>19:075:001 Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.</p>
			<p>19:075:002 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.</p>
			<p>19:075:003 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:075:004 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:</p>
			<p>19:075:005 Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.</p>
			<p>19:075:006 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.</p>
			<p>19:075:007 But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.</p>
			<p>19:075:008 For in the hand of the <b>Lord</b> there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.</p>
			<p>19:075:009 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</p>
			<p>19:075:010 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.</p>
			<p>19:076:001 In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.</p>
			<p>19:076:002 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.</p>
			<p>19:076:003 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:076:004 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.</p>
			<p>19:076:005 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.</p>
			<p>19:076:006 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.</p>
			<p>19:076:007 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?</p>
			<p>19:076:008 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,</p>
			<p>19:076:009 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:076:010 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.</p>
			<p>19:076:011 Vow, and pay unto the <b>Lord</b> your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.</p>
			<p>19:076:012 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.</p>
			<p>19:077:001 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.</p>
			<p>19:077:002 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.</p>
			<p>19:077:003 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:077:004 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</p>
			<p>19:077:005 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.</p>
			<p>19:077:006 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.</p>
			<p>19:077:007 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?</p>
			<p>19:077:008 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?</p>
			<p>19:077:009 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.</p>
			<p>19:077:010 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.</p>
			<p>19:077:011 I will remember the works of the <b>Lord</b>: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.</p>
			<p>19:077:012 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.</p>
			<p>19:077:013 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?</p>
			<p>19:077:014 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.</p>
			<p>19:077:015 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:077:016 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.</p>
			<p>19:077:017 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.</p>
			<p>19:077:018 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.</p>
			<p>19:077:019 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.</p>
			<p>19:077:020 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</p>
			<p>19:078:001 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</p>
			<p>19:078:002 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:</p>
			<p>19:078:003 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</p>
			<p>19:078:004 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the <b>Lord</b>, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.</p>
			<p>19:078:005 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:</p>
			<p>19:078:006 That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:</p>
			<p>19:078:007 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:</p>
			<p>19:078:008 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</p>
			<p>19:078:009 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.</p>
			<p>19:078:010 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</p>
			<p>19:078:011 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</p>
			<p>19:078:012 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</p>
			<p>19:078:013 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.</p>
			<p>19:078:014 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.</p>
			<p>19:078:015 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.</p>
			<p>19:078:016 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</p>
			<p>19:078:017 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.</p>
			<p>19:078:018 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.</p>
			<p>19:078:019 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?</p>
			<p>19:078:020 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?</p>
			<p>19:078:021 Therefore the <b>Lord</b> heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</p>
			<p>19:078:022 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:</p>
			<p>19:078:023 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,</p>
			<p>19:078:024 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.</p>
			<p>19:078:025 Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.</p>
			<p>19:078:026 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.</p>
			<p>19:078:027 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:</p>
			<p>19:078:028 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.</p>
			<p>19:078:029 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;</p>
			<p>19:078:030 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,</p>
			<p>19:078:031 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</p>
			<p>19:078:032 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.</p>
			<p>19:078:033 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</p>
			<p>19:078:034 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.</p>
			<p>19:078:035 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.</p>
			<p>19:078:036 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</p>
			<p>19:078:037 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</p>
			<p>19:078:038 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.</p>
			<p>19:078:039 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</p>
			<p>19:078:040 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!</p>
			<p>19:078:041 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.</p>
			<p>19:078:042 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.</p>
			<p>19:078:043 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan.</p>
			<p>19:078:044 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.</p>
			<p>19:078:045 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.</p>
			<p>19:078:046 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.</p>
			<p>19:078:047 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.</p>
			<p>19:078:048 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p>
			<p>19:078:049 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</p>
			<p>19:078:050 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</p>
			<p>19:078:051 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</p>
			<p>19:078:052 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p>
			<p>19:078:053 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p>
			<p>19:078:054 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</p>
			<p>19:078:055 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p>
			<p>19:078:056 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:</p>
			<p>19:078:057 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>
			<p>19:078:058 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</p>
			<p>19:078:059 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</p>
			<p>19:078:060 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;</p>
			<p>19:078:061 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.</p>
			<p>19:078:062 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.</p>
			<p>19:078:063 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.</p>
			<p>19:078:064 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.</p>
			<p>19:078:065 Then the <b>Lord</b> awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</p>
			<p>19:078:066 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.</p>
			<p>19:078:067 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:</p>
			<p>19:078:068 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</p>
			<p>19:078:069 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.</p>
			<p>19:078:070 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</p>
			<p>19:078:071 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</p>
			<p>19:078:072 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</p>
			<p>19:079:001 O god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.</p>
			<p>19:079:002 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.</p>
			<p>19:079:003 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.</p>
			<p>19:079:004 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us.</p>
			<p>19:079:005 How long, <b>Lord</b>? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like fire?</p>
			<p>19:079:006 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.</p>
			<p>19:079:007 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.</p>
			<p>19:079:008 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.</p>
			<p>19:079:009 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake.</p>
			<p>19:079:010 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed.</p>
			<p>19:079:011 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;</p>
			<p>19:079:012 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.</p>
			<p>19:079:013 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.</p>
			<p>19:080:001 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.</p>
			<p>19:080:002 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us.</p>
			<p>19:080:003 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>
			<p>19:080:004 O <b>Lord</b> God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?</p>
			<p>19:080:005 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.</p>
			<p>19:080:006 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.</p>
			<p>19:080:007 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>
			<p>19:080:008 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.</p>
			<p>19:080:009 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.</p>
			<p>19:080:010 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.</p>
			<p>19:080:011 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.</p>
			<p>19:080:012 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?</p>
			<p>19:080:013 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.</p>
			<p>19:080:014 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;</p>
			<p>19:080:015 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.</p>
			<p>19:080:016 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.</p>
			<p>19:080:017 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.</p>
			<p>19:080:018 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.</p>
			<p>19:080:019 Turn us again, O <b>Lord</b> God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.</p>
			<p>19:081:001 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.</p>
			<p>19:081:002 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.</p>
			<p>19:081:003 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.</p>
			<p>19:081:004 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.</p>
			<p>19:081:005 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.</p>
			<p>19:081:006 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.</p>
			<p>19:081:007 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:081:008 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;</p>
			<p>19:081:009 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.</p>
			<p>19:081:010 I am the <b>Lord</b> thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</p>
			<p>19:081:011 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.</p>
			<p>19:081:012 So I gave them up unto their own hearts’ lust: and they walked in their own counsels.</p>
			<p>19:081:013 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!</p>
			<p>19:081:014 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.</p>
			<p>19:081:015 The haters of the <b>Lord</b> should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.</p>
			<p>19:081:016 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.</p>
			<p>19:082:001 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods.</p>
			<p>19:082:002 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.</p>
			<p>19:082:003 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.</p>
			<p>19:082:004 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.</p>
			<p>19:082:005 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.</p>
			<p>19:082:006 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.</p>
			<p>19:082:007 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.</p>
			<p>19:082:008 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.</p>
			<p>19:083:001 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.</p>
			<p>19:083:002 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.</p>
			<p>19:083:003 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.</p>
			<p>19:083:004 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.</p>
			<p>19:083:005 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:</p>
			<p>19:083:006 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;</p>
			<p>19:083:007 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;</p>
			<p>19:083:008 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:083:009 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:</p>
			<p>19:083:010 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.</p>
			<p>19:083:011 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:</p>
			<p>19:083:012 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.</p>
			<p>19:083:013 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.</p>
			<p>19:083:014 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;</p>
			<p>19:083:015 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.</p>
			<p>19:083:016 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:083:017 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:</p>
			<p>19:083:018 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is <b>Jehovah</b>, art the most high over all the earth.</p>
			<p>19:084:001 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O <b>Lord</b> of hosts!</p>
			<p>19:084:002 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the <b>Lord</b>: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.</p>
			<p>19:084:003 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O <b>Lord</b> of hosts, my King, and my God.</p>
			<p>19:084:004 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:084:005 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.</p>
			<p>19:084:006 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.</p>
			<p>19:084:007 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.</p>
			<p>19:084:008 O <b>Lord</b> God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:084:009 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.</p>
			<p>19:084:010 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.</p>
			<p>19:084:011 For the <b>Lord</b> God is a sun and shield: the <b>Lord</b> will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.</p>
			<p>19:084:012 O <b>Lord</b> of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.</p>
			<p>19:085:001 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.</p>
			<p>19:085:002 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:085:003 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.</p>
			<p>19:085:004 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.</p>
			<p>19:085:005 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?</p>
			<p>19:085:006 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?</p>
			<p>19:085:007 Shew us thy mercy, O <b>Lord</b>, and grant us thy salvation.</p>
			<p>19:085:008 I will hear what God the <b>Lord</b> will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.</p>
			<p>19:085:009 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.</p>
			<p>19:085:010 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</p>
			<p>19:085:011 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.</p>
			<p>19:085:012 Yea, the <b>Lord</b> shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.</p>
			<p>19:085:013 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.</p>
			<p>19:086:001 Bow down thine ear, O <b>Lord</b>, hear me: for I am poor and needy.</p>
			<p>19:086:002 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.</p>
			<p>19:086:003 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.</p>
			<p>19:086:004 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.</p>
			<p>19:086:005 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.</p>
			<p>19:086:006 Give ear, O <b>Lord</b>, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.</p>
			<p>19:086:007 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.</p>
			<p>19:086:008 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works.</p>
			<p>19:086:009 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.</p>
			<p>19:086:010 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.</p>
			<p>19:086:011 Teach me thy way, O <b>Lord</b>; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.</p>
			<p>19:086:012 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.</p>
			<p>19:086:013 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.</p>
			<p>19:086:014 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.</p>
			<p>19:086:015 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.</p>
			<p>19:086:016 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.</p>
			<p>19:086:017 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, <b>Lord</b>, hast holpen me, and comforted me.</p>
			<p>19:087:001 His foundation is in the holy mountains.</p>
			<p>19:087:002 The <b>Lord</b> loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</p>
			<p>19:087:003 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:087:004 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.</p>
			<p>19:087:005 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her: and the highest himself shall establish her.</p>
			<p>19:087:006 The <b>Lord</b> shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:087:007 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there: all my springs are in thee.</p>
			<p>19:088:001 O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:</p>
			<p>19:088:002 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;</p>
			<p>19:088:003 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.</p>
			<p>19:088:004 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength:</p>
			<p>19:088:005 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.</p>
			<p>19:088:006 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.</p>
			<p>19:088:007 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:088:008 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.</p>
			<p>19:088:009 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: <b>Lord</b>, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.</p>
			<p>19:088:010 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah.</p>
			<p>19:088:011 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction?</p>
			<p>19:088:012 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?</p>
			<p>19:088:013 But unto thee have I cried, O <b>Lord</b>; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.</p>
			<p>19:088:014 <b>Lord</b>, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me?</p>
			<p>19:088:015 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.</p>
			<p>19:088:016 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.</p>
			<p>19:088:017 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.</p>
			<p>19:088:018 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.</p>
			<p>19:089:001 I will sing of the mercies of the <b>Lord</b> for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.</p>
			<p>19:089:002 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.</p>
			<p>19:089:003 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,</p>
			<p>19:089:004 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:089:005 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O <b>Lord</b>: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.</p>
			<p>19:089:006 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the <b>Lord</b>? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the <b>Lord</b>?</p>
			<p>19:089:007 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.</p>
			<p>19:089:008 O <b>Lord</b> God of hosts, who is a strong <b>Lord</b> like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?</p>
			<p>19:089:009 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.</p>
			<p>19:089:010 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.</p>
			<p>19:089:011 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.</p>
			<p>19:089:012 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.</p>
			<p>19:089:013 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.</p>
			<p>19:089:014 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.</p>
			<p>19:089:015 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O <b>Lord</b>, in the light of thy countenance.</p>
			<p>19:089:016 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.</p>
			<p>19:089:017 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.</p>
			<p>19:089:018 For the <b>Lord</b> is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king.</p>
			<p>19:089:019 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.</p>
			<p>19:089:020 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:</p>
			<p>19:089:021 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.</p>
			<p>19:089:022 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.</p>
			<p>19:089:023 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.</p>
			<p>19:089:024 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.</p>
			<p>19:089:025 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.</p>
			<p>19:089:026 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.</p>
			<p>19:089:027 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.</p>
			<p>19:089:028 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.</p>
			<p>19:089:029 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.</p>
			<p>19:089:030 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;</p>
			<p>19:089:031 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;</p>
			<p>19:089:032 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.</p>
			<p>19:089:033 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.</p>
			<p>19:089:034 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</p>
			<p>19:089:035 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.</p>
			<p>19:089:036 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.</p>
			<p>19:089:037 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:089:038 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.</p>
			<p>19:089:039 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.</p>
			<p>19:089:040 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.</p>
			<p>19:089:041 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.</p>
			<p>19:089:042 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.</p>
			<p>19:089:043 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.</p>
			<p>19:089:044 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.</p>
			<p>19:089:045 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:089:046 How long, <b>Lord</b>? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?</p>
			<p>19:089:047 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?</p>
			<p>19:089:048 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.</p>
			<p>19:089:049 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?</p>
			<p>19:089:050 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;</p>
			<p>19:089:051 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O <b>Lord</b>; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.</p>
			<p>19:089:052 Blessed be the <b>Lord</b> for evermore. Amen, and Amen.</p>
			<p>19:090:001 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.</p>
			<p>19:090:002 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.</p>
			<p>19:090:003 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.</p>
			<p>19:090:004 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.</p>
			<p>19:090:005 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.</p>
			<p>19:090:006 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.</p>
			<p>19:090:007 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.</p>
			<p>19:090:008 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.</p>
			<p>19:090:009 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.</p>
			<p>19:090:010 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</p>
			<p>19:090:011 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.</p>
			<p>19:090:012 So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.</p>
			<p>19:090:013 Return, O <b>Lord</b>, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.</p>
			<p>19:090:014 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</p>
			<p>19:090:015 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.</p>
			<p>19:090:016 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.</p>
			<p>19:090:017 And let the beauty of the <b>Lord</b> our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.</p>
			<p>19:091:001 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.</p>
			<p>19:091:002 I will say of the <b>Lord</b>, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.</p>
			<p>19:091:003 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.</p>
			<p>19:091:004 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.</p>
			<p>19:091:005 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;</p>
			<p>19:091:006 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.</p>
			<p>19:091:007 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.</p>
			<p>19:091:008 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.</p>
			<p>19:091:009 Because thou hast made the <b>Lord</b>, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;</p>
			<p>19:091:010 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.</p>
			<p>19:091:011 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.</p>
			<p>19:091:012 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.</p>
			<p>19:091:013 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.</p>
			<p>19:091:014 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.</p>
			<p>19:091:015 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.</p>
			<p>19:091:016 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.</p>
			<h5>19:092:001 IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE <b>Lord</b>, AND TO SING PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH:</h5>
			<p>19:092:002 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,</p>
			<p>19:092:003 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.</p>
			<p>19:092:004 For thou, <b>Lord</b>, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.</p>
			<p>19:092:005 O <b>Lord</b>, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.</p>
			<p>19:092:006 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.</p>
			<p>19:092:007 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:</p>
			<p>19:092:008 But thou, <b>Lord</b>, art most high for evermore.</p>
			<p>19:092:009 For, lo, thine enemies, O <b>Lord</b>, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.</p>
			<p>19:092:010 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.</p>
			<p>19:092:011 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.</p>
			<p>19:092:012 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</p>
			<p>19:092:013 Those that be planted in the house of the <b>Lord</b> shall flourish in the courts of our God.</p>
			<p>19:092:014 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;</p>
			<p>19:092:015 To shew that the <b>Lord</b> is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</p>
			<p>19:093:001 The <b>Lord</b> reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the <b>Lord</b> is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.</p>
			<p>19:093:002 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.</p>
			<p>19:093:003 The floods have lifted up, O <b>Lord</b>, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.</p>
			<p>19:093:004 The <b>Lord</b> on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.</p>
			<p>19:093:005 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O <b>Lord</b>, for ever.</p>
			<p>19:094:001 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.</p>
			<p>19:094:002 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.</p>
			<p>19:094:003 <b>Lord</b>, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?</p>
			<p>19:094:004 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?</p>
			<p>19:094:005 They break in pieces thy people, O <b>Lord</b>, and afflict thine heritage.</p>
			<p>19:094:006 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.</p>
			<p>19:094:007 Yet they say, The <b>Lord</b> shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.</p>
			<p>19:094:008 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?</p>
			<p>19:094:009 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?</p>
			<p>19:094:010 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?</p>
			<p>19:094:011 The <b>Lord</b> knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.</p>
			<p>19:094:012 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O <b>Lord</b>, and teachest him out of thy law;</p>
			<p>19:094:013 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.</p>
			<p>19:094:014 For the <b>Lord</b> will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.</p>
			<p>19:094:015 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.</p>
			<p>19:094:016 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?</p>
			<p>19:094:017 Unless the <b>Lord</b> had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.</p>
			<p>19:094:018 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O <b>Lord</b>, held me up.</p>
			<p>19:094:019 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.</p>
			<p>19:094:020 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?</p>
			<p>19:094:021 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.</p>
			<p>19:094:022 But the <b>Lord</b> is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.</p>
			<p>19:094:023 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the <b>Lord</b> our God shall cut them off.</p>
			<p>19:095:001 O come, let us sing unto the <b>Lord</b>: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.</p>
			<p>19:095:002 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.</p>
			<p>19:095:003 For the <b>Lord</b> is a great God, and a great King above all gods.</p>
			<p>19:095:004 In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.</p>
			<p>19:095:005 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.</p>
			<p>19:095:006 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the <b>Lord</b> our maker.</p>
			<p>19:095:007 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,</p>
			<p>19:095:008 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</p>
			<p>19:095:009 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.</p>
			<p>19:095:010 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:</p>
			<p>19:095:011 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.</p>
			<p>19:096:001 O sing unto the <b>Lord</b> a new song: sing unto the <b>Lord</b>, all the earth.</p>
			<p>19:096:002 Sing unto the <b>Lord</b>, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.</p>
			<p>19:096:003 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.</p>
			<p>19:096:004 For the <b>Lord</b> is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.</p>
			<p>19:096:005 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the <b>Lord</b> made the heavens.</p>
			<p>19:096:006 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.</p>
			<p>19:096:007 Give unto the <b>Lord</b>, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the <b>Lord</b> glory and strength.</p>
			<p>19:096:008 Give unto the <b>Lord</b> the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.</p>
			<p>19:096:009 O worship the <b>Lord</b> in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.</p>
			<p>19:096:010 Say among the heathen that the <b>Lord</b> reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.</p>
			<p>19:096:011 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.</p>
			<p>19:096:012 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice</p>
			<p>19:096:013 Before the <b>Lord</b>: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.</p>
			<p>19:097:001 The <b>Lord</b> reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.</p>
			<p>19:097:002 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.</p>
			<p>19:097:003 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.</p>
			<p>19:097:004 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.</p>
			<p>19:097:005 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the <b>Lord</b>, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.</p>
			<p>19:097:006 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.</p>
			<p>19:097:007 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.</p>
			<p>19:097:008 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:097:009 For thou, <b>Lord</b>, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.</p>
			<p>19:097:010 Ye that love the <b>Lord</b>, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.</p>
			<p>19:097:011 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.</p>
			<p>19:097:012 Rejoice in the <b>Lord</b>, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.</p>
			<p>19:098:001 O sing unto the <b>Lord</b> a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.</p>
			<p>19:098:002 The <b>Lord</b> hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.</p>
			<p>19:098:003 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</p>
			<p>19:098:004 Make a joyful noise unto the <b>Lord</b>, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.</p>
			<p>19:098:005 Sing unto the <b>Lord</b> with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.</p>
			<p>19:098:006 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the <b>Lord</b>, the King.</p>
			<p>19:098:007 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.</p>
			<p>19:098:008 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together</p>
			<p>19:098:009 Before the <b>Lord</b>; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.</p>
			<p>19:099:001 The <b>Lord</b> reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.</p>
			<p>19:099:002 The <b>Lord</b> is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.</p>
			<p>19:099:003 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.</p>
			<p>19:099:004 The king’s strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.</p>
			<p>19:099:005 Exalt ye the <b>Lord</b> our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.</p>
			<p>19:099:006 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the <b>Lord</b>, and he answered them.</p>
			<p>19:099:007 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.</p>
			<p>19:099:008 Thou answeredst them, O <b>Lord</b> our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.</p>
			<p>19:099:009 Exalt the <b>Lord</b> our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the <b>Lord</b> our God is holy.</p>
			<p>19:100:001 Make a joyful noise unto the <b>Lord</b>, all ye lands.</p>
			<p>19:100:002 Serve the <b>Lord</b> with gladness: come before his presence with singing.</p>
			<p>19:100:003 Know ye that the <b>Lord</b> he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.</p>
			<p>19:100:004 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.</p>
			<p>19:100:005 For the <b>Lord</b> is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.</p>
			<p>19:101:001 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O <b>Lord</b>, will I sing.</p>
			<p>19:101:002 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.</p>
			<p>19:101:003 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.</p>
			<p>19:101:004 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.</p>
			<p>19:101:005 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.</p>
			<p>19:101:006 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.</p>
			<p>19:101:007 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.</p>
			<p>19:101:008 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:102:001 Hear my prayer, O <b>Lord</b>, and let my cry come unto thee.</p>
			<p>19:102:002 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.</p>
			<p>19:102:003 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.</p>
			<p>19:102:004 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.</p>
			<p>19:102:005 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.</p>
			<p>19:102:006 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.</p>
			<p>19:102:007 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.</p>
			<p>19:102:008 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.</p>
			<p>19:102:009 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping.</p>
			<p>19:102:010 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.</p>
			<p>19:102:011 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.</p>
			<p>19:102:012 But thou, O <b>Lord</b>, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.</p>
			<p>19:102:013 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.</p>
			<p>19:102:014 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.</p>
			<p>19:102:015 So the heathen shall fear the name of the <b>Lord</b>, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.</p>
			<p>19:102:016 When the <b>Lord</b> shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.</p>
			<p>19:102:017 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.</p>
			<p>19:102:018 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:102:019 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the <b>Lord</b> behold the earth;</p>
			<p>19:102:020 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;</p>
			<p>19:102:021 To declare the name of the <b>Lord</b> in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;</p>
			<p>19:102:022 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:102:023 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.</p>
			<p>19:102:024 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.</p>
			<p>19:102:025 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.</p>
			<p>19:102:026 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:</p>
			<p>19:102:027 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.</p>
			<p>19:102:028 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.</p>
			<p>19:103:001 Bless the <b>Lord</b>, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.</p>
			<p>19:103:002 Bless the <b>Lord</b>, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:</p>
			<p>19:103:003 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;</p>
			<p>19:103:004 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;</p>
			<p>19:103:005 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s.</p>
			<p>19:103:006 The <b>Lord</b> executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.</p>
			<p>19:103:007 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.</p>
			<p>19:103:008 The <b>Lord</b> is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.</p>
			<p>19:103:009 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.</p>
			<p>19:103:010 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</p>
			<p>19:103:011 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.</p>
			<p>19:103:012 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.</p>
			<p>19:103:013 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the <b>Lord</b> pitieth them that fear him.</p>
			<p>19:103:014 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.</p>
			<p>19:103:015 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.</p>
			<p>19:103:016 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.</p>
			<p>19:103:017 But the mercy of the <b>Lord</b> is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children’s children;</p>
			<p>19:103:018 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.</p>
			<p>19:103:019 The <b>Lord</b> hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.</p>
			<p>19:103:020 Bless the <b>Lord</b>, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.</p>
			<p>19:103:021 Bless ye the <b>Lord</b>, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.</p>
			<p>19:103:022 Bless the <b>Lord</b>, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the <b>Lord</b>, O my soul.</p>
			<p>19:104:001 Bless the <b>Lord</b>, O my soul. O <b>Lord</b> my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.</p>
			<p>19:104:002 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:</p>
			<p>19:104:003 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:</p>
			<p>19:104:004 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:</p>
			<p>19:104:005 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.</p>
			<p>19:104:006 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.</p>
			<p>19:104:007 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.</p>
			<p>19:104:008 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.</p>
			<p>19:104:009 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.</p>
			<p>19:104:010 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.</p>
			<p>19:104:011 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.</p>
			<p>19:104:012 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.</p>
			<p>19:104:013 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.</p>
			<p>19:104:014 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;</p>
			<p>19:104:015 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man’s heart.</p>
			<p>19:104:016 The trees of the <b>Lord</b> are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;</p>
			<p>19:104:017 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.</p>
			<p>19:104:018 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.</p>
			<p>19:104:019 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.</p>
			<p>19:104:020 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.</p>
			<p>19:104:021 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.</p>
			<p>19:104:022 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.</p>
			<p>19:104:023 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.</p>
			<p>19:104:024 O <b>Lord</b>, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.</p>
			<p>19:104:025 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.</p>
			<p>19:104:026 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.</p>
			<p>19:104:027 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.</p>
			<p>19:104:028 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.</p>
			<p>19:104:029 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.</p>
			<p>19:104:030 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.</p>
			<p>19:104:031 The glory of the <b>Lord</b> shall endure for ever: the <b>Lord</b> shall rejoice in his works.</p>
			<p>19:104:032 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.</p>
			<p>19:104:033 I will sing unto the <b>Lord</b> as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.</p>
			<p>19:104:034 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:104:035 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the <b>Lord</b>, O my soul. Praise ye the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:105:001 O give thanks unto the <b>Lord</b>; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.</p>
			<p>19:105:002 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.</p>
			<p>19:105:003 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:105:004 Seek the <b>Lord</b>, and his strength: seek his face evermore.</p>
			<p>19:105:005 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</p>
			<p>19:105:006 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.</p>
			<p>19:105:007 He is the <b>Lord</b> our God: his judgments are in all the earth.</p>
			<p>19:105:008 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.</p>
			<p>19:105:009 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;</p>
			<p>19:105:010 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:</p>
			<p>19:105:011 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:</p>
			<p>19:105:012 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.</p>
			<p>19:105:013 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;</p>
			<p>19:105:014 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;</p>
			<p>19:105:015 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</p>
			<p>19:105:016 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.</p>
			<p>19:105:017 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:</p>
			<p>19:105:018 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:</p>
			<p>19:105:019 Until the time that his word came: the word of the <b>Lord</b> tried him.</p>
			<p>19:105:020 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.</p>
			<p>19:105:021 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:</p>
			<p>19:105:022 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.</p>
			<p>19:105:023 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</p>
			<p>19:105:024 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.</p>
			<p>19:105:025 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.</p>
			<p>19:105:026 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.</p>
			<p>19:105:027 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.</p>
			<p>19:105:028 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.</p>
			<p>19:105:029 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</p>
			<p>19:105:030 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.</p>
			<p>19:105:031 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.</p>
			<p>19:105:032 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.</p>
			<p>19:105:033 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.</p>
			<p>19:105:034 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,</p>
			<p>19:105:035 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.</p>
			<p>19:105:036 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.</p>
			<p>19:105:037 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.</p>
			<p>19:105:038 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.</p>
			<p>19:105:039 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.</p>
			<p>19:105:040 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</p>
			<p>19:105:041 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.</p>
			<p>19:105:042 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.</p>
			<p>19:105:043 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:</p>
			<p>19:105:044 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;</p>
			<p>19:105:045 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:106:001 Praise ye the <b>Lord</b>. O give thanks unto the <b>Lord</b>; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:106:002 Who can utter the mighty acts of the <b>Lord</b>? who can shew forth all his praise?</p>
			<p>19:106:003 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.</p>
			<p>19:106:004 Remember me, O <b>Lord</b>, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;</p>
			<p>19:106:005 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</p>
			<p>19:106:006 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</p>
			<p>19:106:007 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.</p>
			<p>19:106:008 Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</p>
			<p>19:106:009 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</p>
			<p>19:106:010 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>
			<p>19:106:011 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</p>
			<p>19:106:012 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</p>
			<p>19:106:013 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</p>
			<p>19:106:014 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</p>
			<p>19:106:015 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</p>
			<p>19:106:016 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:106:017 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.</p>
			<p>19:106:018 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</p>
			<p>19:106:019 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</p>
			<p>19:106:020 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</p>
			<p>19:106:021 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</p>
			<p>19:106:022 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.</p>
			<p>19:106:023 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</p>
			<p>19:106:024 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</p>
			<p>19:106:025 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:106:026 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</p>
			<p>19:106:027 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</p>
			<p>19:106:028 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p>
			<p>19:106:029 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</p>
			<p>19:106:030 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.</p>
			<p>19:106:031 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</p>
			<p>19:106:032 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</p>
			<p>19:106:033 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</p>
			<p>19:106:034 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the <b>Lord</b> commanded them:</p>
			<p>19:106:035 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</p>
			<p>19:106:036 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</p>
			<p>19:106:037 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</p>
			<p>19:106:038 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</p>
			<p>19:106:039 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</p>
			<p>19:106:040 Therefore was the wrath of the <b>Lord</b> kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</p>
			<p>19:106:041 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</p>
			<p>19:106:042 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</p>
			<p>19:106:043 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</p>
			<p>19:106:044 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</p>
			<p>19:106:045 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
			<p>19:106:046 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</p>
			<p>19:106:047 Save us, O <b>Lord</b> our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.</p>
			<p>19:106:048 Blessed be the <b>Lord</b> God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:107:001 O give thanks unto the <b>Lord</b>, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:107:002 Let the redeemed of the <b>Lord</b> say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;</p>
			<p>19:107:003 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.</p>
			<p>19:107:004 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.</p>
			<p>19:107:005 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</p>
			<p>19:107:006 Then they cried unto the <b>Lord</b> in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.</p>
			<p>19:107:007 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</p>
			<p>19:107:008 Oh that men would praise the <b>Lord</b> for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
			<p>19:107:009 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.</p>
			<p>19:107:010 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;</p>
			<p>19:107:011 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:</p>
			<p>19:107:012 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.</p>
			<p>19:107:013 Then they cried unto the <b>Lord</b> in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.</p>
			<p>19:107:014 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.</p>
			<p>19:107:015 Oh that men would praise the <b>Lord</b> for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
			<p>19:107:016 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.</p>
			<p>19:107:017 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</p>
			<p>19:107:018 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.</p>
			<p>19:107:019 Then they cry unto the <b>Lord</b> in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.</p>
			<p>19:107:020 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.</p>
			<p>19:107:021 Oh that men would praise the <b>Lord</b> for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
			<p>19:107:022 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.</p>
			<p>19:107:023 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;</p>
			<p>19:107:024 These see the works of the <b>Lord</b>, and his wonders in the deep.</p>
			<p>19:107:025 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.</p>
			<p>19:107:026 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</p>
			<p>19:107:027 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit’s end.</p>
			<p>19:107:028 Then they cry unto the <b>Lord</b> in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.</p>
			<p>19:107:029 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.</p>
			<p>19:107:030 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</p>
			<p>19:107:031 Oh that men would praise the <b>Lord</b> for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
			<p>19:107:032 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</p>
			<p>19:107:033 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</p>
			<p>19:107:034 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</p>
			<p>19:107:035 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</p>
			<p>19:107:036 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</p>
			<p>19:107:037 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</p>
			<p>19:107:038 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</p>
			<p>19:107:039 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</p>
			<p>19:107:040 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.</p>
			<p>19:107:041 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.</p>
			<p>19:107:042 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</p>
			<p>19:107:043 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:108:001 O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.</p>
			<p>19:108:002 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.</p>
			<p>19:108:003 I will praise thee, O <b>Lord</b>, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.</p>
			<p>19:108:004 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.</p>
			<p>19:108:005 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;</p>
			<p>19:108:006 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me.</p>
			<p>19:108:007 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.</p>
			<p>19:108:008 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;</p>
			<p>19:108:009 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.</p>
			<p>19:108:010 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?</p>
			<p>19:108:011 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?</p>
			<p>19:108:012 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.</p>
			<p>19:108:013 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.</p>
			<p>19:109:001 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;</p>
			<p>19:109:002 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.</p>
			<p>19:109:003 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.</p>
			<p>19:109:004 For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.</p>
			<p>19:109:005 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</p>
			<p>19:109:006 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.</p>
			<p>19:109:007 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.</p>
			<p>19:109:008 Let his days be few; and let another take his office.</p>
			<p>19:109:009 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</p>
			<p>19:109:010 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.</p>
			<p>19:109:011 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.</p>
			<p>19:109:012 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.</p>
			<p>19:109:013 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.</p>
			<p>19:109:014 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the <b>Lord</b>; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</p>
			<p>19:109:015 Let them be before the <b>Lord</b> continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</p>
			<p>19:109:016 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.</p>
			<p>19:109:017 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.</p>
			<p>19:109:018 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.</p>
			<p>19:109:019 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.</p>
			<p>19:109:020 Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the <b>Lord</b>, and of them that speak evil against my soul.</p>
			<p>19:109:021 But do thou for me, O <b>God</b> the Lord, for thy name’s sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.</p>
			<p>19:109:022 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</p>
			<p>19:109:023 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.</p>
			<p>19:109:024 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.</p>
			<p>19:109:025 I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.</p>
			<p>19:109:026 Help me, O <b>Lord</b> my God: O save me according to thy mercy:</p>
			<p>19:109:027 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, <b>Lord</b>, hast done it.</p>
			<p>19:109:028 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.</p>
			<p>19:109:029 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.</p>
			<p>19:109:030 I will greatly praise the <b>Lord</b> with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.</p>
			<p>19:109:031 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.</p>
			<p>19:110:001 The <b>Lord</b> said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.</p>
			<p>19:110:002 The <b>Lord</b> shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.</p>
			<p>19:110:003 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.</p>
			<p>19:110:004 The <b>Lord</b> hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.</p>
			<p>19:110:005 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath.</p>
			<p>19:110:006 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.</p>
			<p>19:110:007 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.</p>
			<p>19:111:001 Praise ye the <b>Lord</b>. I will praise the <b>Lord</b> with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.</p>
			<p>19:111:002 The works of the <b>Lord</b> are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.</p>
			<p>19:111:003 His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:111:004 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the <b>Lord</b> is gracious and full of compassion.</p>
			<p>19:111:005 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.</p>
			<p>19:111:006 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.</p>
			<p>19:111:007 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.</p>
			<p>19:111:008 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.</p>
			<p>19:111:009 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.</p>
			<p>19:111:010 The fear of the <b>Lord</b> is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:112:001 Praise ye the <b>Lord</b>. Blessed is the man that feareth the <b>Lord</b>, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.</p>
			<p>19:112:002 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.</p>
			<p>19:112:003 Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:112:004 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.</p>
			<p>19:112:005 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.</p>
			<p>19:112:006 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.</p>
			<p>19:112:007 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:112:008 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.</p>
			<p>19:112:009 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.</p>
			<p>19:112:010 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.</p>
			<p>19:113:001 Praise ye the <b>Lord</b>. Praise, O ye servants of the <b>Lord</b>, praise the name of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:113:002 Blessed be the name of the <b>Lord</b> from this time forth and for evermore.</p>
			<p>19:113:003 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the <b>Lord</b>’s name is to be praised.</p>
			<p>19:113:004 The <b>Lord</b> is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens.</p>
			<p>19:113:005 Who is like unto the <b>Lord</b> our God, who dwelleth on high,</p>
			<p>19:113:006 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!</p>
			<p>19:113:007 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill;</p>
			<p>19:113:008 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.</p>
			<p>19:113:009 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:114:001 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;</p>
			<p>19:114:002 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.</p>
			<p>19:114:003 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.</p>
			<p>19:114:004 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.</p>
			<p>19:114:005 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?</p>
			<p>19:114:006 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?</p>
			<p>19:114:007 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;</p>
			<p>19:114:008 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.</p>
			<p>19:115:001 Not unto us, O <b>Lord</b>, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth’s sake.</p>
			<p>19:115:002 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?</p>
			<p>19:115:003 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.</p>
			<p>19:115:004 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.</p>
			<p>19:115:005 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:</p>
			<p>19:115:006 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:</p>
			<p>19:115:007 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.</p>
			<p>19:115:008 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.</p>
			<p>19:115:009 O Israel, trust thou in the <b>Lord</b>: he is their help and their shield.</p>
			<p>19:115:010 O house of Aaron, trust in the <b>Lord</b>: he is their help and their shield.</p>
			<p>19:115:011 Ye that fear the <b>Lord</b>, trust in the <b>Lord</b>: he is their help and their shield.</p>
			<p>19:115:012 The <b>Lord</b> hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.</p>
			<p>19:115:013 He will bless them that fear the <b>Lord</b>, both small and great.</p>
			<p>19:115:014 The <b>Lord</b> shall increase you more and more, you and your children.</p>
			<p>19:115:015 Ye are blessed of the <b>Lord</b> which made heaven and earth.</p>
			<p>19:115:016 The heaven, even the heavens, are the <b>Lord</b>’s: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.</p>
			<p>19:115:017 The dead praise not the <b>Lord</b>, neither any that go down into silence.</p>
			<p>19:115:018 But we will bless the <b>Lord</b> from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:116:001 I love the <b>Lord</b>, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.</p>
			<p>19:116:002 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.</p>
			<p>19:116:003 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.</p>
			<p>19:116:004 Then called I upon the name of the <b>Lord</b>; O <b>Lord</b>, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.</p>
			<p>19:116:005 Gracious is the <b>Lord</b>, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.</p>
			<p>19:116:006 The <b>Lord</b> preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.</p>
			<p>19:116:007 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the <b>Lord</b> hath dealt bountifully with thee.</p>
			<p>19:116:008 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.</p>
			<p>19:116:009 I will walk before the <b>Lord</b> in the land of the living.</p>
			<p>19:116:010 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:</p>
			<p>19:116:011 I said in my haste, All men are liars.</p>
			<p>19:116:012 What shall I render unto the <b>Lord</b> for all his benefits toward me?</p>
			<p>19:116:013 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:116:014 I will pay my vows unto the <b>Lord</b> now in the presence of all his people.</p>
			<p>19:116:015 Precious in the sight of the <b>Lord</b> is the death of his saints.</p>
			<p>19:116:016 O <b>Lord</b>, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.</p>
			<p>19:116:017 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:116:018 I will pay my vows unto the <b>Lord</b> now in the presence of all his people.</p>
			<p>19:116:019 In the courts of the <b>Lord</b>’s house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:117:001 O praise the <b>Lord</b>, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.</p>
			<p>19:117:002 For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of the <b>Lord</b> endureth for ever. Praise ye the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:118:001 O give thanks unto the <b>Lord</b>; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:118:002 Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:118:003 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:118:004 Let them now that fear the <b>Lord</b> say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:118:005 I called upon the <b>Lord</b> in distress: the <b>Lord</b> answered me, and set me in a large place.</p>
			<p>19:118:006 The <b>Lord</b> is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?</p>
			<p>19:118:007 The <b>Lord</b> taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.</p>
			<p>19:118:008 It is better to trust in the <b>Lord</b> than to put confidence in man.</p>
			<p>19:118:009 It is better to trust in the <b>Lord</b> than to put confidence in princes.</p>
			<p>19:118:010 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the <b>Lord</b> will I destroy them.</p>
			<p>19:118:011 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the <b>Lord</b> I will destroy them.</p>
			<p>19:118:012 They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the <b>Lord</b> I will destroy them.</p>
			<p>19:118:013 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the <b>Lord</b> helped me.</p>
			<p>19:118:014 The <b>Lord</b> is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.</p>
			<p>19:118:015 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the <b>Lord</b> doeth valiantly.</p>
			<p>19:118:016 The right hand of the <b>Lord</b> is exalted: the right hand of the <b>Lord</b> doeth valiantly.</p>
			<p>19:118:017 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:118:018 The <b>Lord</b> hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.</p>
			<p>19:118:019 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the <b>Lord</b>:</p>
			<p>19:118:020 This gate of the <b>Lord</b>, into which the righteous shall enter.</p>
			<p>19:118:021 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.</p>
			<p>19:118:022 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.</p>
			<p>19:118:023 This is the <b>Lord</b>’s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.</p>
			<p>19:118:024 This is the day which the <b>Lord</b> hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.</p>
			<p>19:118:025 Save now, I beseech thee, O <b>Lord</b>: O <b>Lord</b>, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.</p>
			<p>19:118:026 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the <b>Lord</b>: we have blessed you out of the house of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:118:027 God is the <b>Lord</b>, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.</p>
			<p>19:118:028 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.</p>
			<p>19:118:029 O give thanks unto the <b>Lord</b>; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:119:001 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:119:002 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.</p>
			<p>19:119:003 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.</p>
			<p>19:119:004 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.</p>
			<p>19:119:005 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!</p>
			<p>19:119:006 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.</p>
			<p>19:119:007 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.</p>
			<p>19:119:008 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.</p>
			<p>19:119:009 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:010 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.</p>
			<p>19:119:011 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.</p>
			<p>19:119:012 Blessed art thou, O <b>Lord</b>: teach me thy statutes.</p>
			<p>19:119:013 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.</p>
			<p>19:119:014 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.</p>
			<p>19:119:015 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.</p>
			<p>19:119:016 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:017 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:018 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.</p>
			<p>19:119:019 I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.</p>
			<p>19:119:020 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times.</p>
			<p>19:119:021 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.</p>
			<p>19:119:022 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.</p>
			<p>19:119:023 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.</p>
			<p>19:119:024 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.</p>
			<p>19:119:025 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:026 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.</p>
			<p>19:119:027 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.</p>
			<p>19:119:028 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:029 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.</p>
			<p>19:119:030 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me.</p>
			<p>19:119:031 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O <b>Lord</b>, put me not to shame.</p>
			<p>19:119:032 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.</p>
			<p>19:119:033 Teach me, O <b>Lord</b>, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end.</p>
			<p>19:119:034 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.</p>
			<p>19:119:035 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.</p>
			<p>19:119:036 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.</p>
			<p>19:119:037 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.</p>
			<p>19:119:038 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.</p>
			<p>19:119:039 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good.</p>
			<p>19:119:040 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.</p>
			<p>19:119:041 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O <b>Lord</b>, even thy salvation, according to thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:042 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:043 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.</p>
			<p>19:119:044 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.</p>
			<p>19:119:045 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.</p>
			<p>19:119:046 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.</p>
			<p>19:119:047 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.</p>
			<p>19:119:048 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.</p>
			<p>19:119:049 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.</p>
			<p>19:119:050 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.</p>
			<p>19:119:051 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.</p>
			<p>19:119:052 I remembered thy judgments of old, O <b>Lord</b>; and have comforted myself.</p>
			<p>19:119:053 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.</p>
			<p>19:119:054 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.</p>
			<p>19:119:055 I have remembered thy name, O <b>Lord</b>, in the night, and have kept thy law.</p>
			<p>19:119:056 This I had, because I kept thy precepts.</p>
			<p>19:119:057 Thou art my portion, O <b>Lord</b>: I have said that I would keep thy words.</p>
			<p>19:119:058 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:059 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.</p>
			<p>19:119:060 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.</p>
			<p>19:119:061 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.</p>
			<p>19:119:062 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.</p>
			<p>19:119:063 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.</p>
			<p>19:119:064 The earth, O <b>Lord</b>, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.</p>
			<p>19:119:065 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O <b>Lord</b>, according unto thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:066 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.</p>
			<p>19:119:067 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:068 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.</p>
			<p>19:119:069 The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.</p>
			<p>19:119:070 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.</p>
			<p>19:119:071 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.</p>
			<p>19:119:072 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.</p>
			<p>19:119:073 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.</p>
			<p>19:119:074 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:075 I know, O <b>Lord</b>, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.</p>
			<p>19:119:076 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.</p>
			<p>19:119:077 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight.</p>
			<p>19:119:078 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.</p>
			<p>19:119:079 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.</p>
			<p>19:119:080 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.</p>
			<p>19:119:081 My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:082 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?</p>
			<p>19:119:083 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.</p>
			<p>19:119:084 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?</p>
			<p>19:119:085 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.</p>
			<p>19:119:086 All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.</p>
			<p>19:119:087 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.</p>
			<p>19:119:088 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.</p>
			<p>19:119:089 For ever, O <b>Lord</b>, thy word is settled in heaven.</p>
			<p>19:119:090 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.</p>
			<p>19:119:091 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.</p>
			<p>19:119:092 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.</p>
			<p>19:119:093 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.</p>
			<p>19:119:094 I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.</p>
			<p>19:119:095 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.</p>
			<p>19:119:096 I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.</p>
			<p>19:119:097 O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.</p>
			<p>19:119:098 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.</p>
			<p>19:119:099 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.</p>
			<p>19:119:100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.</p>
			<p>19:119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.</p>
			<p>19:119:103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!</p>
			<p>19:119:104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.</p>
			<p>19:119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</p>
			<p>19:119:106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.</p>
			<p>19:119:107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O <b>Lord</b>, according unto thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O <b>Lord</b>, and teach me thy judgments.</p>
			<p>19:119:109 My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.</p>
			<p>19:119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.</p>
			<p>19:119:111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.</p>
			<p>19:119:112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.</p>
			<p>19:119:113 I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.</p>
			<p>19:119:114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.</p>
			<p>19:119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.</p>
			<p>19:119:117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.</p>
			<p>19:119:118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.</p>
			<p>19:119:119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.</p>
			<p>19:119:120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.</p>
			<p>19:119:121 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.</p>
			<p>19:119:122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.</p>
			<p>19:119:123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.</p>
			<p>19:119:124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.</p>
			<p>19:119:125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.</p>
			<p>19:119:126 It is time for thee, <b>Lord</b>, to work: for they have made void thy law.</p>
			<p>19:119:127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.</p>
			<p>19:119:128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way.</p>
			<p>19:119:129 Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them.</p>
			<p>19:119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.</p>
			<p>19:119:131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments.</p>
			<p>19:119:132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.</p>
			<p>19:119:133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.</p>
			<p>19:119:134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts.</p>
			<p>19:119:135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.</p>
			<p>19:119:136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.</p>
			<p>19:119:137 Righteous art thou, O <b>Lord</b>, and upright are thy judgments.</p>
			<p>19:119:138 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.</p>
			<p>19:119:139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.</p>
			<p>19:119:140 Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.</p>
			<p>19:119:141 I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.</p>
			<p>19:119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.</p>
			<p>19:119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights.</p>
			<p>19:119:144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.</p>
			<p>19:119:145 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O <b>Lord</b>: I will keep thy statutes.</p>
			<p>19:119:146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.</p>
			<p>19:119:147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O <b>Lord</b>, quicken me according to thy judgment.</p>
			<p>19:119:150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law.</p>
			<p>19:119:151 Thou art near, O <b>Lord</b>; and all thy commandments are truth.</p>
			<p>19:119:152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.</p>
			<p>19:119:153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law.</p>
			<p>19:119:154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes.</p>
			<p>19:119:156 Great are thy tender mercies, O <b>Lord</b>: quicken me according to thy judgments.</p>
			<p>19:119:157 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies.</p>
			<p>19:119:158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O <b>Lord</b>, according to thy lovingkindness.</p>
			<p>19:119:160 Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:162 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.</p>
			<p>19:119:163 I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.</p>
			<p>19:119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.</p>
			<p>19:119:165 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them.</p>
			<p>19:119:166 <b>Lord</b>, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.</p>
			<p>19:119:167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.</p>
			<p>19:119:168 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.</p>
			<p>19:119:169 Let my cry come near before thee, O <b>Lord</b>: give me understanding according to thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word.</p>
			<p>19:119:171 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.</p>
			<p>19:119:172 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness.</p>
			<p>19:119:173 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.</p>
			<p>19:119:174 I have longed for thy salvation, O <b>Lord</b>; and thy law is my delight.</p>
			<p>19:119:175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.</p>
			<p>19:119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.</p>
			<p>19:120:001 In my distress I cried unto the <b>Lord</b>, and he heard me.</p>
			<p>19:120:002 Deliver my soul, O <b>Lord</b>, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue.</p>
			<p>19:120:003 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?</p>
			<p>19:120:004 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.</p>
			<p>19:120:005 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!</p>
			<p>19:120:006 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.</p>
			<p>19:120:007 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.</p>
			<p>19:121:001 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.</p>
			<p>19:121:002 My help cometh from the <b>Lord</b>, which made heaven and earth.</p>
			<p>19:121:003 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber.</p>
			<p>19:121:004 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.</p>
			<p>19:121:005 The <b>Lord</b> is thy keeper: the <b>Lord</b> is thy shade upon thy right hand.</p>
			<p>19:121:006 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.</p>
			<p>19:121:007 The <b>Lord</b> shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.</p>
			<p>19:121:008 The <b>Lord</b> shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.</p>
			<p>19:122:001 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:122:002 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.</p>
			<p>19:122:003 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:</p>
			<p>19:122:004 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the <b>Lord</b>, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:122:005 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.</p>
			<p>19:122:006 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.</p>
			<p>19:122:007 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.</p>
			<p>19:122:008 For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.</p>
			<p>19:122:009 Because of the house of the <b>Lord</b> our God I will seek thy good.</p>
			<p>19:123:001 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.</p>
			<p>19:123:002 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the <b>Lord</b> our God, until that he have mercy upon us.</p>
			<p>19:123:003 Have mercy upon us, O <b>Lord</b>, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.</p>
			<p>19:123:004 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.</p>
			<p>19:124:001 If it had not been the <b>Lord</b> who was on our side, now may Israel say;</p>
			<p>19:124:002 If it had not been the <b>Lord</b> who was on our side, when men rose up against us:</p>
			<p>19:124:003 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:</p>
			<p>19:124:004 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:</p>
			<p>19:124:005 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.</p>
			<p>19:124:006 Blessed be the <b>Lord</b>, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.</p>
			<p>19:124:007 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.</p>
			<p>19:124:008 Our help is in the name of the <b>Lord</b>, who made heaven and earth.</p>
			<p>19:125:001 They that trust in the <b>Lord</b> shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:125:002 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the <b>Lord</b> is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.</p>
			<p>19:125:003 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.</p>
			<p>19:125:004 Do good, O <b>Lord</b>, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts.</p>
			<p>19:125:005 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the <b>Lord</b> shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.</p>
			<p>19:126:001 When the <b>Lord</b> turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.</p>
			<p>19:126:002 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The <b>Lord</b> hath done great things for them.</p>
			<p>19:126:003 The <b>Lord</b> hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.</p>
			<p>19:126:004 Turn again our captivity, O <b>Lord</b>, as the streams in the south.</p>
			<p>19:126:005 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.</p>
			<p>19:126:006 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.</p>
			<p>19:127:001 Except the <b>Lord</b> build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the <b>Lord</b> keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.</p>
			<p>19:127:002 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.</p>
			<p>19:127:003 Lo, children are an heritage of the <b>Lord</b>: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.</p>
			<p>19:127:004 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.</p>
			<p>19:127:005 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.</p>
			<p>19:128:001 Blessed is every one that feareth the <b>Lord</b>; that walketh in his ways.</p>
			<p>19:128:002 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.</p>
			<p>19:128:003 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.</p>
			<p>19:128:004 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:128:005 The <b>Lord</b> shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.</p>
			<p>19:128:006 Yea, thou shalt see thy children’s children, and peace upon Israel.</p>
			<p>19:129:001 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:</p>
			<p>19:129:002 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.</p>
			<p>19:129:003 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.</p>
			<p>19:129:004 The <b>Lord</b> is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.</p>
			<p>19:129:005 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.</p>
			<p>19:129:006 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:</p>
			<p>19:129:007 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.</p>
			<p>19:129:008 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the <b>Lord</b> be upon you: we bless you in the name of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:130:001 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:130:002 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.</p>
			<p>19:130:003 If thou, <b>Lord</b>, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?</p>
			<p>19:130:004 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.</p>
			<p>19:130:005 I wait for the <b>Lord</b>, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.</p>
			<p>19:130:006 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.</p>
			<p>19:130:007 Let Israel hope in the <b>Lord</b>: for with the <b>Lord</b> there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.</p>
			<p>19:130:008 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.</p>
			<p>19:131:001 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.</p>
			<p>19:131:002 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.</p>
			<p>19:131:003 Let Israel hope in the <b>Lord</b> from henceforth and for ever.</p>
			<p>19:132:001 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:</p>
			<p>19:132:002 How he sware unto the <b>Lord</b>, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;</p>
			<p>19:132:003 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;</p>
			<p>19:132:004 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,</p>
			<p>19:132:005 Until I find out a place for the <b>Lord</b>, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.</p>
			<p>19:132:006 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.</p>
			<p>19:132:007 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.</p>
			<p>19:132:008 Arise, O <b>Lord</b>, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.</p>
			<p>19:132:009 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.</p>
			<p>19:132:010 For thy servant David’s sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.</p>
			<p>19:132:011 The <b>Lord</b> hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.</p>
			<p>19:132:012 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.</p>
			<p>19:132:013 For the <b>Lord</b> hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.</p>
			<p>19:132:014 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.</p>
			<p>19:132:015 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.</p>
			<p>19:132:016 I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.</p>
			<p>19:132:017 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.</p>
			<p>19:132:018 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.</p>
			<p>19:133:001 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!</p>
			<p>19:133:002 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron’s beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;</p>
			<p>19:133:003 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the <b>Lord</b> commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.</p>
			<p>19:134:001 Behold, bless ye the <b>Lord</b>, all ye servants of the <b>Lord</b>, which by night stand in the house of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:134:002 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:134:003 The <b>Lord</b> that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.</p>
			<p>19:135:001 Praise ye the <b>Lord</b>. Praise ye the name of the <b>Lord</b>; praise him, O ye servants of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:135:002 Ye that stand in the house of the <b>Lord</b>, in the courts of the house of our God.</p>
			<p>19:135:003 Praise the <b>Lord</b>; for the <b>Lord</b> is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.</p>
			<p>19:135:004 For the <b>Lord</b> hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.</p>
			<p>19:135:005 For I know that the <b>Lord</b> is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.</p>
			<p>19:135:006 Whatsoever the <b>Lord</b> pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.</p>
			<p>19:135:007 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.</p>
			<p>19:135:008 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.</p>
			<p>19:135:009 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.</p>
			<p>19:135:010 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;</p>
			<p>19:135:011 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:</p>
			<p>19:135:012 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.</p>
			<p>19:135:013 Thy name, O <b>Lord</b>, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O <b>Lord</b>, throughout all generations.</p>
			<p>19:135:014 For the <b>Lord</b> will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.</p>
			<p>19:135:015 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.</p>
			<p>19:135:016 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;</p>
			<p>19:135:017 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.</p>
			<p>19:135:018 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them.</p>
			<p>19:135:019 Bless the <b>Lord</b>, O house of Israel: bless the <b>Lord</b>, O house of Aaron:</p>
			<p>19:135:020 Bless the <b>Lord</b>, O house of Levi: ye that fear the <b>Lord</b>, bless the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:135:021 Blessed be the <b>Lord</b> out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:136:001 O give thanks unto the <b>Lord</b>; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:136:002 O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:136:003 O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:136:004 To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:136:005 To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:136:006 To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:136:007 To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
			<p>19:136:008 The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
			<p>19:136:009 The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:136:010 To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
			<p>19:136:011 And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
			<p>19:136:012 With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:136:013 To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
			<p>19:136:014 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
			<p>19:136:015 But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:136:016 To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:136:017 To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
			<p>19:136:018 And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
			<p>19:136:019 Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
			<p>19:136:020 And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
			<p>19:136:021 And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
			<p>19:136:022 Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:136:023 Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth for ever:</p>
			<p>19:136:024 And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:136:025 Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:136:026 O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
			<p>19:137:001 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.</p>
			<p>19:137:002 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.</p>
			<p>19:137:003 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.</p>
			<p>19:137:004 How shall we sing the <b>Lord</b>’s song in a strange land?</p>
			<p>19:137:005 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.</p>
			<p>19:137:006 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.</p>
			<p>19:137:007 Remember, O <b>Lord</b>, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.</p>
			<p>19:137:008 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.</p>
			<p>19:137:009 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.</p>
			<p>19:138:001 I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.</p>
			<p>19:138:002 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.</p>
			<p>19:138:003 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.</p>
			<p>19:138:004 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O <b>Lord</b>, when they hear the words of thy mouth.</p>
			<p>19:138:005 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the <b>Lord</b>: for great is the glory of the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:138:006 Though the <b>Lord</b> be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off.</p>
			<p>19:138:007 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.</p>
			<p>19:138:008 The <b>Lord</b> will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O <b>Lord</b>, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own hands.</p>
			<p>19:139:001 O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.</p>
			<p>19:139:002 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.</p>
			<p>19:139:003 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.</p>
			<p>19:139:004 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O <b>Lord</b>, thou knowest it altogether.</p>
			<p>19:139:005 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.</p>
			<p>19:139:006 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.</p>
			<p>19:139:007 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?</p>
			<p>19:139:008 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.</p>
			<p>19:139:009 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;</p>
			<p>19:139:010 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.</p>
			<p>19:139:011 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.</p>
			<p>19:139:012 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.</p>
			<p>19:139:013 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother’s womb.</p>
			<p>19:139:014 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.</p>
			<p>19:139:015 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.</p>
			<p>19:139:016 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.</p>
			<p>19:139:017 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them!</p>
			<p>19:139:018 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.</p>
			<p>19:139:019 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.</p>
			<p>19:139:020 For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.</p>
			<p>19:139:021 Do not I hate them, O <b>Lord</b>, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?</p>
			<p>19:139:022 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.</p>
			<p>19:139:023 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:</p>
			<p>19:139:024 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.</p>
			<p>19:140:001 Deliver me, O <b>Lord</b>, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;</p>
			<p>19:140:002 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war.</p>
			<p>19:140:003 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders’ poison is under their lips. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:140:004 Keep me, O <b>Lord</b>, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.</p>
			<p>19:140:005 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:140:006 I said unto the <b>Lord</b>, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:140:007 O <b>God</b> the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.</p>
			<p>19:140:008 Grant not, O <b>Lord</b>, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:140:009 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.</p>
			<p>19:140:010 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.</p>
			<p>19:140:011 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.</p>
			<p>19:140:012 I know that the <b>Lord</b> will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor.</p>
			<p>19:140:013 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.</p>
			<p>19:141:001 Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.</p>
			<p>19:141:002 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.</p>
			<p>19:141:003 Set a watch, O <b>Lord</b>, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.</p>
			<p>19:141:004 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.</p>
			<p>19:141:005 Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.</p>
			<p>19:141:006 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.</p>
			<p>19:141:007 Our bones are scattered at the grave’s mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.</p>
			<p>19:141:008 But mine eyes are unto thee, O <b>God</b> the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.</p>
			<p>19:141:009 Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.</p>
			<p>19:141:010 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.</p>
			<p>19:142:001 I cried unto the <b>Lord</b> with my voice; with my voice unto the <b>Lord</b> did I make my supplication.</p>
			<p>19:142:002 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.</p>
			<p>19:142:003 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.</p>
			<p>19:142:004 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.</p>
			<p>19:142:005 I cried unto thee, O <b>Lord</b>: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.</p>
			<p>19:142:006 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.</p>
			<p>19:142:007 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.</p>
			<p>19:143:001 Hear my prayer, O <b>Lord</b>, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.</p>
			<p>19:143:002 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.</p>
			<p>19:143:003 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.</p>
			<p>19:143:004 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.</p>
			<p>19:143:005 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.</p>
			<p>19:143:006 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.</p>
			<p>19:143:007 Hear me speedily, O <b>Lord</b>: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.</p>
			<p>19:143:008 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.</p>
			<p>19:143:009 Deliver me, O <b>Lord</b>, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.</p>
			<p>19:143:010 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.</p>
			<p>19:143:011 Quicken me, O <b>Lord</b>, for thy name’s sake: for thy righteousness’ sake bring my soul out of trouble.</p>
			<p>19:143:012 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.</p>
			<p>19:144:001 Blessed be the <b>Lord</b> my strength which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:</p>
			<p>19:144:002 My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.</p>
			<p>19:144:003 <b>Lord</b>, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!</p>
			<p>19:144:004 Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.</p>
			<p>19:144:005 Bow thy heavens, O <b>Lord</b>, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.</p>
			<p>19:144:006 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.</p>
			<p>19:144:007 Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;</p>
			<p>19:144:008 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</p>
			<p>19:144:009 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.</p>
			<p>19:144:010 It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.</p>
			<p>19:144:011 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:</p>
			<p>19:144:012 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:</p>
			<p>19:144:013 That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:</p>
			<p>19:144:014 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.</p>
			<p>19:144:015 Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:145:001 I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.</p>
			<p>19:145:002 Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.</p>
			<p>19:145:003 Great is the <b>Lord</b>, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable.</p>
			<p>19:145:004 One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.</p>
			<p>19:145:005 I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works.</p>
			<p>19:145:006 And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness.</p>
			<p>19:145:007 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.</p>
			<p>19:145:008 The <b>Lord</b> is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy.</p>
			<p>19:145:009 The <b>Lord</b> is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.</p>
			<p>19:145:010 All thy works shall praise thee, O <b>Lord</b>; and thy saints shall bless thee.</p>
			<p>19:145:011 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;</p>
			<p>19:145:012 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.</p>
			<p>19:145:013 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.</p>
			<p>19:145:014 The <b>Lord</b> upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down.</p>
			<p>19:145:015 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.</p>
			<p>19:145:016 Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.</p>
			<p>19:145:017 The <b>Lord</b> is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.</p>
			<p>19:145:018 The <b>Lord</b> is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.</p>
			<p>19:145:019 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.</p>
			<p>19:145:020 The <b>Lord</b> preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.</p>
			<p>19:145:021 My mouth shall speak the praise of the <b>Lord</b>: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.</p>
			<p>19:146:001 Praise ye the <b>Lord</b>. Praise the <b>Lord</b>, O my soul.</p>
			<p>19:146:002 While I live will I praise the <b>Lord</b>: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.</p>
			<p>19:146:003 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.</p>
			<p>19:146:004 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.</p>
			<p>19:146:005 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the <b>Lord</b> his God:</p>
			<p>19:146:006 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever:</p>
			<p>19:146:007 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The <b>Lord</b> looseth the prisoners:</p>
			<p>19:146:008 The <b>Lord</b> openeth the eyes of the blind: the <b>Lord</b> raiseth them that are bowed down: the <b>Lord</b> loveth the righteous:</p>
			<p>19:146:009 The <b>Lord</b> preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.</p>
			<p>19:146:010 The <b>Lord</b> shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the <b>Lord</b>.</p>
			<p>19:147:001 Praise ye the <b>Lord</b>: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.</p>
			<p>19:147:002 The <b>Lord</b> doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.</p>
			<p>19:147:003 He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.</p>
			<p>19:147:004 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names.</p>
			<p>19:147:005 Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.</p>
			<p>19:147:006 The <b>Lord</b> lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground.</p>
			<p>19:147:007 Sing unto the <b>Lord</b> with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God:</p>
			<p>19:147:008 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.</p>
			<p>19:147:009 He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.</p>
			<p>19:147:010 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.</p>
			<p>19:147:011 The <b>Lord</b> taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.</p>
			<p>19:147:012 Praise the <b>Lord</b>, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.</p>
			<p>19:147:013 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.</p>
			<p>19:147:014 He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.</p>
			<p>19:147:015 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.</p>
