					<p class="first-child"><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001001">1</sup>God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001002">2</sup>Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001003">3</sup>Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001004">4</sup>Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001005">5</sup>For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001006">6</sup>And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001007">7</sup>And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001008">8</sup>But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001009">9</sup>Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001010">10</sup>And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001011">11</sup>They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001012">12</sup>And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001013">13</sup>But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-001014">14</sup>Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?</p>

					<p class="first-child"><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002001">1</sup>Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002002">2</sup>For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002003">3</sup>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002004">4</sup>God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002005">5</sup>For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002006">6</sup>But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou visitest him?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002007">7</sup>Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002008">8</sup>Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002009">9</sup>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002010">10</sup>For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002011">11</sup>For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002012">12</sup>Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002013">13</sup>And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002014">14</sup>Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002015">15</sup>And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002016">16</sup>For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002017">17</sup>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-002018">18</sup>For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003001">1</sup>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003002">2</sup>Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003003">3</sup>For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003004">4</sup>For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003005">5</sup>And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003006">6</sup>But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003007">7</sup>Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003008">8</sup>Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003009">9</sup>When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003010">10</sup>Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003011">11</sup>So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003012">12</sup>Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003013">13</sup>But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003014">14</sup>For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003015">15</sup>While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003016">16</sup>For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003017">17</sup>But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003018">18</sup>And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-003019">19</sup>So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004001">1</sup>Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004002">2</sup>For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004003">3</sup>For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004004">4</sup>For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004005">5</sup>And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004006">6</sup>Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004007">7</sup>Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004008">8</sup>For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004009">9</sup>There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004010">10</sup>For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004011">11</sup>Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004012">12</sup>For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004013">13</sup>Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004014">14</sup>Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004015">15</sup>For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-004016">16</sup>Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005001">1</sup>For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005002">2</sup>Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005003">3</sup>And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005004">4</sup>And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005005">5</sup>So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005006">6</sup>As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005007">7</sup>Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005008">8</sup>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005009">9</sup>And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005010">10</sup>Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005011">11</sup>Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005012">12</sup>For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005013">13</sup>For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-005014">14</sup>But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006001">1</sup>Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006002">2</sup>Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006003">3</sup>And this will we do, if God permit.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006004">4</sup>For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006005">5</sup>And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006006">6</sup>If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006007">7</sup>For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006008">8</sup>But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006009">9</sup>But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006010">10</sup>For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006011">11</sup>And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006012">12</sup>That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006013">13</sup>For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006014">14</sup>Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006015">15</sup>And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006016">16</sup>For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006017">17</sup>Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006018">18</sup>That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006019">19</sup>Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-006020">20</sup>Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007001">1</sup>For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007002">2</sup>To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007003">3</sup>Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007004">4</sup>Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007005">5</sup>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007006">6</sup>But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007007">7</sup>And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007008">8</sup>And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007009">9</sup>And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007010">10</sup>For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007011">11</sup>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007012">12</sup>For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007013">13</sup>For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007014">14</sup>For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007015">15</sup>And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007016">16</sup>Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007017">17</sup>For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007018">18</sup>For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007019">19</sup>For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007020">20</sup>And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007021">21</sup>(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007022">22</sup>By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007023">23</sup>And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007024">24</sup>But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007025">25</sup>Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007026">26</sup>For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007027">27</sup>Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-007028">28</sup>For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-008006">6</sup>But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009001">1</sup>Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009002">2</sup>For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009003">3</sup>And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009004">4</sup>Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009005">5</sup>And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009006">6</sup>Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009007">7</sup>But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009008">8</sup>The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009009">9</sup>Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009010">10</sup>Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009011">11</sup>But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009012">12</sup>Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009013">13</sup>For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009014">14</sup>How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009015">15</sup>And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009016">16</sup>For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009017">17</sup>For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009018">18</sup>Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009019">19</sup>For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009020">20</sup>Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009021">21</sup>Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009022">22</sup>And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009023">23</sup>It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009024">24</sup>For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009025">25</sup>Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009026">26</sup>For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009027">27</sup>And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-009028">28</sup>So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010002">2</sup>For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010003">3</sup>But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010004">4</sup>For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010005">5</sup>Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010010">10</sup>By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010011">11</sup>And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010012">12</sup>But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010013">13</sup>From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010014">14</sup>For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-010015">15</sup>Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011003">3</sup>Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-011004">4</sup>By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</p>

					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012026">26</sup>Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012027">27</sup>And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012028">28</sup>Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-012029">29</sup>For our God is a consuming fire.</p>

					<p class="first-child"><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013001">1</sup>Let brotherly love continue.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013002">2</sup>Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013003">3</sup>Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013004">4</sup>Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013005">5</sup>Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013006">6</sup>So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013007">7</sup>Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013008">8</sup>Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013009">9</sup>Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013010">10</sup>We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013011">11</sup>For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013012">12</sup>Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013013">13</sup>Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013014">14</sup>For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013015">15</sup>By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013016">16</sup>But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013017">17</sup>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013018">18</sup>Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013019">19</sup>But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013020">20</sup>Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013021">21</sup>Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013022">22</sup>And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013023">23</sup>Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013024">24</sup>Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.</p>
					<p><sup class="verse-number" id="verse-013025">25</sup>Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
